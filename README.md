# Natural Language Processing to Identify Directional Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI)

A BioBERT-based NLP model to perform relation extraction (RE) and named entity recognition (NER) to identify directional DDIs.  Model weights are from [BioBERT-Large v1.1](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert).  Training and validation scripts are modified from [https://github.com/kamalkraj/BERT-NER-TF](https://github.com/kamalkraj/BERT-NER-TF) and implemented with TensorFlow v2.

## Requirements

- `python3`
- `tensorflow` (version >= 2.0)
- `fastprogress` (version >= 0.1.21)
- `seqeval` (version >= 0.0.5)

## Sub-directories

- `BERT-TF-master` contains the main scripts for training and validation
- `DDI_data` contains the training and validation datasets for RE and NER steps

## Usage

- Download [BioBERT-Large v1.1](http://nlp.dmis.korea.edu/projects/biobert-2020-checkpoints/biobert_large_v1.1_pubmed.tar.gz).  Save as a sub-directory, e.g. 'biobert_large'.
- Convert TensorFlow version 1 model weights to TensorFlow version 2 model weights; follow procedure in `tf1_convert_tf2.sh`.
- First, run training and validation for RE step.  To do this, run `myrun_re.py` under `BERT-TF-master` directory.  An example bash script, `example_re.sh`, shows the various command line arguments supplied to `myrun_re.py`.  Output is written in `REoutput` directory.
- Second, run training and validation for NER step.  To do this, run `myrun_ner.py` under `BERT-TF-master` directory, followed by `myner_detokenize.py` under `BERT-TF-master/biocodes` directory.  An example bash script, `example_ner.sh`, shows the various command line arguments supplied to both these scripts.  Output is written in `NERoutput` directory.
