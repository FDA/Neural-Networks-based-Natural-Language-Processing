0	IMPORTANT DISPENSING INFORMATION For every patient, TEMODAR must be dispensed in a separate vial or in its original package making sure each container lists the strength per capsule and that patients take the appropriate number of capsules from each package or vial.
0	Please see the dispensing instructions below for more information.
0	Known hypersensitivity to any TEMODAR component or to dacarbazine (DTIC).
0	TEMODAR (temozolomide) is contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity reaction (such as urticaria, allergic reaction including anaphylaxis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to any of its components.
0	TEMODAR is also contraindicated in patients who have a history of hypersensitivity to dacarbazine (DTIC), since both drugs are metabolized to 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)-imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC).
0	Newly Diagnosed GBM: 75 mg/m2 for 42 days concomitant with focal radiotherapy followed by initial maintenance dose of 150 mg/m2 once daily for Days 1<U+2013>5 of a 28-day cycle of TEMODAR for 6 cycles.

0	Complete blood counts should be obtained throughout the treatment course as specified.
0	Hepatotoxicity <U+2014> fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported.
0	Perform liver function tests at baseline, midway through the first cycle, prior to each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose of TEMODAR.
0	Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman.
0	Women should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant when receiving TEMODAR.
0	As bioequivalence has been established only when given over 90 minutes, infusion over a shorter or longer period of time may result in suboptimal dosing; the possibility of an increase in infusion-related adverse reactions cannot be ruled out.
0	Patients treated with TEMODAR may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia, which may result in aplastic anemia, which in some cases has resulted in a fatal outcome.
0	In some cases, exposure to concomitant medications associated with aplastic anemia, including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, complicates assessment.
0	Prior to dosing, patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 <U+00C3><U+2014> 109/L and a platelet count greater than or equal to 100 <U+00C3><U+2014> 109/L.
0	A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and weekly until the ANC is above 1.5 <U+00C3><U+2014> 109/L and platelet count exceeds 100 <U+00C3><U+2014> 109/L.

0	There may be a higher occurrence of PCP when temozolomide is administered during a longer dosing regimen.
0	However, all patients receiving temozolomide, particularly patients receiving steroids, should be observed closely for the development of PCP regardless of the regimen.
0	For the concomitant treatment phase with RT, a complete blood count should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and weekly during treatment.
0	For the 28-day treatment cycles, a complete blood count should be obtained prior to treatment on Day 1 and on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) of each cycle.
0	Blood counts should be performed weekly until recovery if the ANC falls below 1.5 <U+00C3><U+2014> 109/L and the platelet count falls below 100 <U+00C3><U+2014> 109/L.
0	Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving TEMODAR.
0	TEMODAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
0	Administration of TEMODAR to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at 0.38 and 0.75 times the maximum recommended human dose (75 and 150 mg/m2), respectively, caused numerous fetal malformations of the external organs, soft tissues, and skeleton in both species.
0	As bioequivalence has been established only when TEMODAR for Injection was given over 90 minutes, infusion over a shorter or longer period of time may result in suboptimal dosing.
0	Additionally, the possibility of an increase in infusion-related adverse reactions cannot be ruled out.
0	Temozolomide is not directly active but undergoes rapid nonenzymatic conversion at physiologic pH to the reactive compound 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)-imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC).
0	The cytotoxicity of MTIC is thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA.
0	Alkylation (methylation) occurs mainly at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine.
0	Absorption: Temozolomide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma concentration (Cmax) achieved in a median Tmax of 1 hour.
1	Food reduces the rate and extent of temozolomide absorption.
1	Mean peak plasma concentration and AUC decreased by 32% and 9%, respectively, and median Tmax increased by 2-fold (from 1<U+2013>2.25 hours) when temozolomide was administered after a modified high-fat breakfast.
0	A pharmacokinetic study comparing oral and intravenous temozolomide in 19 patients with primary CNS malignancies showed that 150 mg/m2 TEMODAR for injection administered over 90 minutes is bioequivalent to 150 mg/m2 TEMODAR oral capsules with respect to both Cmax and AUC of temozolomide and MTIC.
0	Following a single 90-minute intravenous infusion of 150 mg/m2, the geometric mean Cmax values for temozolomide and MTIC were 7.3 mcg/mL and 276 ng/mL, respectively.
0	Following a single oral dose of 150 mg/m2, the geometric mean Cmax values for temozolomide and MTIC were 7.5 mcg/mL and 282 ng/mL, respectively.
0	Following a single 90-minute intravenous infusion of 150 mg/m2, the geometric mean AUC values for temozolomide and MTIC were 24.6 mcg<U+2219>hr/mL and 891 ng<U+2219>hr/mL, respectively.
0	Following a single oral dose of 150 mg/m2, the geometric mean AUC values for temozolomide and MTIC were 23.4 mcg<U+2219>hr/mL and 864 ng<U+2219>hr/mL, respectively.
0	Distribution: Temozolomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution of 0.4 L/kg (%CV=13%).
0	It is weakly bound to human plasma proteins; the mean percent bound of drug-related total radioactivity is 15%.
0	Metabolism and Elimination: Temozolomide is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH to the active species, MTIC and to temozolomide acid metabolite.
0	MTIC is further hydrolyzed to 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC), which is known to be an intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to methylhydrazine, which is believed to be the active alkylating species.
0	Cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a minor role in the metabolism of temozolomide and MTIC.
0	Relative to the AUC of temozolomide, the exposure to MTIC and AIC is 2.4% and 23%, respectively.
0	Excretion: About 38% of the administered temozolomide total radioactive dose is recovered over 7 days: 37.7% in urine and 0.8% in feces.
0	The majority of the recovery of radioactivity in urine is unchanged temozolomide (5.6%), AIC (12%), temozolomide acid metabolite (2.3%), and unidentified polar metabolite(s) (17%).
0	Overall clearance of temozolomide is about 5.5 L/hr/m2.
0	Temozolomide is rapidly eliminated, with a mean elimination half-life of 1.8 hours, and exhibits linear kinetics over the therapeutic dosing range of 75 to 250 mg/m2/day.
0	Effect of Age: A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age (range: 19<U+2013>78 years) has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide.
0	Effect of Gender: A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that women have an approximately 5% lower clearance (adjusted for body surface area) for temozolomide than men.
0	Effect of Race: The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide has not been studied.
0	Tobacco Use: A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the oral clearance of temozolomide is similar in smokers and nonsmokers.
0	Effect of Renal Impairment: A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that creatinine clearance over the range of 36 to 130 mL/min/m2 has no effect on the clearance of temozolomide after oral administration.
0	The pharmacokinetics of temozolomide have not been studied in patients with severely impaired renal function (CLcr <36 mL/min/m2).
0	Caution should be exercised when TEMODAR is administered to patients with severe renal impairment.
0	TEMODAR has not been studied in patients on dialysis.
0	Effect of Hepatic Impairment: A study showed that the pharmacokinetics of temozolomide in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class I <U+2013> II) were similar to those observed in patients with normal hepatic function.
0	Caution should be exercised when temozolomide is administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment.
0	Effect of Other Drugs on Temozolomide Pharmacokinetics: In a multiple-dose study, administration of TEMODAR Capsules with ranitidine did not change the Cmax or AUC values for temozolomide or MTIC.
1	A population analysis indicated that administration of valproic acid decreases the clearance of temozolomide by about 5%.
0	A population analysis did not demonstrate any influence of coadministered dexamethasone, prochlorperazine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ondansetron, H2-receptor antagonists, or phenobarbital on the clearance of orally administered temozolomide.
0	RIDAURA<U+00AE> (auranofin) contains gold and, like other gold-containing drugs, can cause gold toxicity, signs of which include: fall in hemoglobin, leukopenia below 4,000 WBC/cu mm, granulocytes below 1,500/cu mm, decrease in platelets below 150,000/cu mm, proteinuria, hematuria, pruritus, rash, stomatitis or persistent diarrhea.
0	Therefore, the results of recommended laboratory work should be reviewed before writing each RIDAURA prescription.
0	Like other gold preparations, RIDAURA is only indicated for use in selected patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.
0	Physicians planning to use RIDAURA should be experienced with chrysotherapy and should thoroughly familiarize themselves with the toxicity and benefits of RIDAURA.
0	In addition, the following precautions should be routinely employed: The possibility of adverse reactions should be explained to patients before starting therapy.
0	Patients should be advised to report promptly any symptoms suggesting toxicity.
0	RIDAURA (auranofin) is contraindicated in patients with a history of any of the following gold-induced disorders: anaphylactic reactions, necrotizing enterocolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, exfoliative dermatitis, bone marrow aplasia or other severe hematologic disorders.
0	Usual Adult Dosage: The usual adult dosage of RIDAURA (auranofin) is 6 mg daily, given either as 3 mg twice daily or 6 mg once daily.
0	Initiation of therapy at dosages exceeding 6 mg daily is not recommended because it is associated with an increased incidence of diarrhea.
0	If response is inadequate after six months, an increase to 9 mg (3 mg three times daily) may be tolerated.
0	If response remains inadequate after a three-month trial of 9 mg daily, RIDAURA therapy should be discontinued.
0	Safety at dosages exceeding 9 mg daily has not been studied.
0	In controlled clinical studies, patients on injectable gold have been transferred to RIDAURA (auranofin) by discontinuing the injectable agent and starting oral therapy with RIDAURA, 6 mg daily.
0	When patients are transferred to RIDAURA, they should be informed of its adverse reaction profile, in particular the gastrointestinal reactions.
0	At six months, control of disease activity of patients transferred to RIDAURA and those maintained on the injectable agent was not different.
0	Data beyond six months are not available.
1	Drug Interactions: In a single patient-report, there is the suggestion that concurrent administration of RIDAURA and phenytoin may have increased phenytoin blood levels.
0	General: The safety of concomitant use of RIDAURA (auranofin) with injectable gold, hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, immunosuppressive agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or methotrexate) or high doses of corticosteroids has not been established.
0	Medical problems that might affect the signs or symptoms used to detect RIDAURA toxicity should be under control before starting RIDAURA (auranofin).
0	The potential benefits of using RIDAURA in patients with progressive renal disease, significant hepatocellular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, skin rash or history of bone marrow depression should be weighed against 1) the potential risks of gold toxicity on organ systems previously compromised or with decreased reserve, and 2) the difficulty in quickly detecting and correctly attributing the toxic effect.
0	The following adverse reactions have been reported with the use of gold preparations and require modification of RIDAURA treatment or additional monitoring.
0	See ADVERSE REACTIONS for the approximate incidence of those reactions specifically reported with RIDAURA.
0	Gastrointestinal Reactions: Gastrointestinal reactions reported with gold therapy include diarrhea/loose stools, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal cramps.
0	The most common reaction to RIDAURA is diarrhea/ loose stools reported in approximately 50% of the patients.
0	This is generally manageable by reducing the dosage (e.g., from 6 mg daily to 3 mg) and in only 6% of the patients is it necessary to discontinue RIDAURA (auranofin) permanently.
0	Ulcerative enterocolitis is a rare serious gold reaction.
0	Therefore, patients with gastrointestinal symptoms should be monitored for the appearance of gastrointestinal bleeding.
0	Cutaneous Reactions: Dermatitis is the most common reaction to injectable gold therapy and the second most common reaction to RIDAURA.
0	Any eruption, especially if pruritic, that develops during treatment should be considered a gold reaction until proven otherwise.
0	Pruritus often exists before dermatitis becomes apparent, and therefore should be considered to be a warning signal of a cutaneous reaction.
0	Gold dermatitis may be aggravated by exposure to sunlight or an actinic rash may develop.
0	The most serious form of cutaneous reaction reported with injectable gold is generalized exfoliative dermatitis.
0	Mucous Membrane Reactions: Stomatitis, another common gold reaction, may be manifested by shallow ulcers on the buccal membranes, on the borders of the tongue, and on the palate or in the pharynx.
0	Stomatitis may occur as the only adverse reaction or with a dermatitis.
0	Sometimes diffuse glossitis or gingivitis develops.
0	A metallic taste may precede these oral mucous membrane reactions and should be considered a warning signal.
0	Renal Reactions: Gold can produce a nephrotic syndrome or glomerulitis with proteinuria and hematuria.
0	These renal reactions are usually relatively mild and subside completely if recognized early and treatment is discontinued.
0	They may become severe and chronic if treatment is continued after the onset of the reaction.
0	Therefore it is important to perform urinalyses regularly and to discontinue treatment promptly if proteinuria or hematuria develops.
0	Hematologic Reactions: Blood dyscrasias including leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and aplastic anemia have all been reported as reactions to injectable gold and RIDAURA.

0	Ensure patients or caregivers receive instruction on proper dosing and administration.
0	Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: May include significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss, and may necessitate treatment interruption.
0	Dehydration may result from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea and can be associated with serious outcomes.
0	Application-site reactions may occur with the patch form of rivastigmine.
0	Discontinue treatment if application-site reactions spread beyond the patch size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g., increasing erythema, edema, papules, vesicles), and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal.
0	Medication errors with EXELON PATCH have resulted in serious adverse reactions; some cases have required hospitalization, and rarely, led to death.
0	The majority of medication errors have involved not removing the old patch when putting on a new one and the use of multiple patches at one time.
0	Instruct patients and their caregivers on important administration instructions for EXELON PATCH.
0	EXELON PATCH can cause gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including significant nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia/decreased appetite, and weight loss.
0	The incidence and severity of these reactions are dose-related.
0	For this reason, initiate treatment with EXELON PATCH at a dose of 4.6 mg/24 hours, and titrate to a dose of 9.5 mg/24 hours and then to a dose of 13.3 mg/24 hours, if appropriate.
0	If treatment is interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, reinitiate EXELON PATCH with the 4.6 mg/24 hours dose to reduce the possibility of severe vomiting and its potentially serious sequelae.
0	A postmarketing report described a case of severe vomiting with esophageal rupture following inappropriate reinitiation of treatment of an oral formulation of rivastigmine without retitration after 8 weeks of treatment interruption.
0	Inform caregivers to monitor for gastrointestinal adverse reactions and to inform the physician if they occur.
0	It is critical to inform caregivers that if therapy has been interrupted for more than 3 days because of intolerance, the next dose should not be administered without contacting the physician regarding proper retitration.
0	Skin application-site reactions may occur with EXELON PATCH.
0	These reactions are not in themselves an indication of sensitization.
0	However, use of rivastigmine patch may lead to allergic contact dermatitis.
0	Allergic contact dermatitis should be suspected if application-site reactions spread beyond the patch size, if there is evidence of a more intense local reaction (e.g., increasing erythema, edema, papules, vesicles), and if symptoms do not significantly improve within 48 hours after patch removal.
0	In these cases, treatment should be discontinued.
0	In patients who develop application-site reactions to EXELON PATCH, suggestive of allergic contact dermatitis and who still require rivastigmine, treatment should be switched to oral rivastigmine only after negative allergy testing and under close medical supervision.
0	It is possible that some patients sensitized to rivastigmine by exposure to rivastigmine patch may not be able to take rivastigmine in any form.
0	There have been isolated postmarketing reports of patients experiencing disseminated allergic dermatitis when administered rivastigmine irrespective of the route of administration (oral or transdermal).
0	Patients and caregivers should be instructed accordingly.
0	Neurologic Effects Extrapyramidal Symptoms: Cholinomimetics, including rivastigmine, may exacerbate or induce extrapyramidal symptoms.
0	Worsening of parkinsonian symptoms, particularly tremor, has been observed in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson<U+2019>s disease who were treated with EXELON Capsules.
0	Seizures: Drugs that increase cholinergic activity are believed to have some potential for causing seizures.
0	However, seizure activity also may be a manifestation of Alzheimer's disease.
0	Peptic Ulcers/Gastrointestinal Bleeding Cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, may increase gastric acid secretion due to increased cholinergic activity.
0	Monitor patients using EXELON PATCH for symptoms of active or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, especially those at increased risk for developing ulcers, e.g., those with a history of ulcer disease or those receiving concurrent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
0	Clinical studies of rivastigmine have shown no significant increase, relative to placebo, in the incidence of either peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.
0	Use with Anesthesia Rivastigmine, as a cholinesterase inhibitor, is likely to exaggerate succinylcholine-type muscle relaxation during anesthesia.
0	Cardiac Conduction Effects Because rivastigmine increases cholinergic activity, use of the EXELON PATCH may have vagotonic effects on heart rate (e.g., bradycardia).
0	The potential for this action may be particularly important in patients with sick sinus syndrome or other supraventricular cardiac conduction conditions.
0	In clinical trials, rivastigmine was not associated with any increased incidence of cardiovascular adverse events, heart rate or blood pressure changes, or electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities.
0	Genitourinary Effects Although not observed in clinical trials of rivastigmine, drugs that increase cholinergic activity may cause urinary obstruction.
0	Pulmonary Effects Drugs that increase cholinergic activity, including EXELON PATCH, should be used with care in patients with a history of asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease.
0	Dementia may cause gradual impairment of driving performance or compromise the ability to use machinery.
0	The administration of rivastigmine may also result in adverse reactions that are detrimental to these functions.
0	During treatment with EXELON PATCH, routinely evaluate the patient's ability to continue driving or operating machinery.
0	Figure 2: Rivastigmine Plasma Concentrations Following Dermal 24-Hour Patch Application Although the precise mechanism of action of rivastigmine is unknown, it is thought to exert its therapeutic effect by enhancing cholinergic function.
0	This is accomplished by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine through reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by cholinesterase.
0	The effect of rivastigmine may lessen as the disease process advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.
0	There is no evidence that rivastigmine alters the course of the underlying dementing process.
0	After a 6-mg oral dose of rivastigmine in humans, anticholinesterase activity is present in cerebrospinal fluid for about 10 hours, with a maximum inhibition of about 60% 5 hours after dosing.
0	In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the inhibition of cholinesterase by rivastigmine is not affected by the concomitant administration of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist.
0	Absorption After the initial application of EXELON PATCH, there is a lag time of 0.5 to 1 hour in the absorption of rivastigmine.
0	Concentrations then rise slowly typically reaching a maximum after 8 hours, although maximum values (Cmax) can also occur later (at 10 to 16 hours).
0	After the peak, plasma concentrations slowly decrease over the remainder of the 24-hour period of application.
0	At steady state, trough levels are approximately 60% to 80% of peak levels.
0	EXELON PATCH 9.5 mg/24 hours gave exposure approximately the same as that provided by an oral dose of 6 mg twice daily (i.e., 12 mg/day).
0	Inter-subject variability in exposure was lower (43% to 49%) for the EXELON PATCH formulation as compared with the oral formulations (73% to 103%).
0	Fluctuation (between Cmax and Cmin) is less for EXELON PATCH than for the oral formulation of rivastigmine.
0	Figure 2 displays rivastigmine plasma concentrations over 24 hours for the 3 available patch strengths.
0	Figure 2: Rivastigmine Plasma Concentrations Following Dermal 24-Hour Patch Application Over a 24-hour dermal application, approximately 50% of the drug content of the patch is released from the system.
0	Exposure area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC<U+221E>) to rivastigmine (and metabolite NAP266-90) was highest when the patch was applied to the upper back, chest, or upper arm.
0	Two other sites (abdomen and thigh) could be used if none of the 3 other sites is available, but the practitioner should be aware that the rivastigmine plasma exposure associated with these sites was approximately 20% to 30% lower.
0	There was no relevant accumulation of rivastigmine or the metabolite NAP226-90 in plasma in patients with Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease with daily dosing.
0	The pharmacokinetic profile of rivastigmine transdermal patches was comparable in patients with Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease and in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson<U+2019>s disease.
0	Distribution Rivastigmine is weakly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 40%) over the therapeutic range.
0	It readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, reaching CSF peak concentrations in 1.4 to 2.6 hours.
0	It has an apparent volume of distribution in the range of 1.8 to 2.7 L/kg.
0	Metabolism Rivastigmine is extensively metabolized primarily via cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to the decarbamylated metabolite NAP226-90.
0	In vitro, this metabolite shows minimal inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (less than 10%).
0	Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies, the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are minimally involved in rivastigmine metabolism.
0	The metabolite-to-parent AUC<U+221E> ratio was about 0.7 after EXELON PATCH application versus 3.5 after oral administration, indicating that much less metabolism occurred after dermal treatment.
0	Less NAP226-90 is formed following patch application, presumably because of the lack of presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism.
0	Based on in vitro studies, no unique metabolic routes were detected in human skin.
0	Elimination Renal excretion of the metabolites is the major route of elimination.
0	Unchanged rivastigmine is found in trace amounts in the urine.
0	Following administration of 14C-rivastigmine, renal elimination was rapid and essentially complete (greater than 90%) within 24 hours.
0	Less than 1% of the administered dose is excreted in the feces.
0	The apparent elimination half-life in plasma is approximately 3 hours after patch removal.
0	Renal clearance was approximately 2.1 to 2.8 L/hr.
0	Age Age had no impact on the exposure to rivastigmine in Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease patients treated with EXELON PATCH.
0	Gender and Race No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effect of gender and race on the disposition of EXELON PATCH.
0	A population pharmacokinetic analysis of oral rivastigmine indicated that neither gender (n = 277 males and 348 females) nor race (n = 575 Caucasian, 34 Black, 4 Asian, and 12 Other) affected clearance of the drug.
0	Similar results were seen with analyses of pharmacokinetic data obtained after the administration of EXELON PATCH.
0	Body Weight A relationship between drug exposure at steady state (rivastigmine and metabolite NAP226-90) and body weight was observed in Alzheimer<U+2019>s dementia patients.
0	Rivastigmine exposure is higher in subjects with low body weight.
0	Compared to a patient with a body weight of 65 kg, the rivastigmine steady-state concentrations in a patient with a body weight of 35 kg would be approximately doubled, while for a patient with a body weight of 100 kg the concentrations would be approximately halved.
0	Renal Impairment No study was conducted with EXELON PATCH in subjects with renal impairment.
0	Based on population analysis, creatinine clearance did not show any clear effect on steady state concentrations of rivastigmine or its metabolite.
0	Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic study was conducted with EXELON PATCH in subjects with hepatic impairment.
0	Following a single 3-mg dose, mean oral clearance of rivastigmine was 60% lower in hepatically impaired patients (n = 10, biopsy proven) than in healthy subjects (n = 10).
0	After multiple 6-mg twice a day oral dosing, the mean clearance of rivastigmine was 65% lower in mild (n = 7, Child-Pugh score 5 to 6) and moderate (n = 3, Child-Pugh score 7 to 9) hepatically impaired patients (biopsy proven, liver cirrhosis) than in healthy subjects (n = 10).
0	Smoking Following oral rivastigmine administration (up to 12 mg/day) with nicotine use, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed increased oral clearance of rivastigmine by 23% (n = 75 smokers and 549 nonsmokers).
0	Drug Interaction Studies No specific interaction studies have been conducted with EXELON PATCH.
0	Information presented below is from studies with oral rivastigmine.
0	Effect of Rivastigmine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases.
0	Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.
0	Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, or CYP2B6.
0	No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine taken orally and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers.
0	The increase in prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of rivastigmine.
0	Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Rivastigmine Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine.
0	Population pharmacokinetic analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine taken orally were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as antacids (n = 77), antihypertensives (n = 72), beta-blockers (n = 42), calcium channel blockers (n = 75), antidiabetics (n = 21), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 79), estrogens (n = 70), salicylate analgesics (n = 177), antianginals (n = 35), and antihistamines (n = 15).

0	In cases where use of a separate ICS and a LABA is clinically indicated, appropriate steps must be taken to ensure adherence with both treatment components.
0	For bronchodilatation and prevention of symptoms of asthma, including the symptoms of nocturnal asthma, the usual dosage for adults and children aged 4 years and older is 1 inhalation (50 mcg) twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.
0	If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual response, medical advice should be sought immediately as this is often a sign of destabilization of asthma.
0	Under these circumstances, the therapeutic regimen should be reevaluated.
0	If symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.
0	Use of SEREVENT DISKUS as a single agent for the prevention of EIB may be clinically indicated in patients who do not have persistent asthma.
0	In patients with persistent asthma, use of SEREVENT DISKUS for the prevention of EIB may be clinically indicated, but the treatment of asthma should include an ICS.
0	One inhalation of SEREVENT DISKUS at least 30 minutes before exercise has been shown to protect patients against EIB.
0	When used intermittently as needed for prevention of EIB, this protection may last up to 9 hours in adults and adolescents and up to 12 hours in patients aged 4 to 11 years.
0	Additional doses of SEREVENT should not be used for 12 hours after the administration of this drug.
0	Patients who are receiving SEREVENT DISKUS twice daily should not use additional SEREVENT for prevention of EIB.
0	For maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with COPD (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema), the dosage for adults is 1 inhalation (50 mcg) twice daily approximately 12 hours apart.
0	Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole): Use not recommended.
0	May increase risk of cardiovascular effects.
0	Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution.
0	May potentiate effect of salmeterol on vascular system.
0	Beta-blockers: Use with caution.
0	May block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm.
0	Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non<U+2013>potassium-sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.
0	Salmeterol is a substrate of CYP3A4.
0	The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with SEREVENT DISKUS is not recommended because increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur.
1	In a drug interaction trial in 20 healthy subjects, coadministration of inhaled salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in greater systemic exposure to salmeterol (AUC increased 16-fold and Cmax increased 1.4-fold).
0	Three (3) subjects were withdrawn due to beta2-agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia).
0	Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration.
0	SEREVENT DISKUS should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents.
0	Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as salmeterol, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma or COPD.
0	Therefore, patients with asthma or COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers.
0	However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.
0	The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non<U+2013>potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.
0	Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of SEREVENT DISKUS with non<U+2013>potassium-sparing diuretics.
0	LABA as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma increase the risk of asthma-related death and asthma-related hospitalizations.
0	Prescribe for asthma only as concomitant therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid.
0	Do not initiate in acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD.
0	Not a substitute for corticosteroids.
0	Patients with asthma must take a concomitant ICS.
0	Do not use in combination with an additional medicine containing a LABA because of risk of overdose.
0	If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue SEREVENT DISKUS and institute alternative therapy.
0	Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or central nervous system disorders because of beta-adrenergic stimulation.
0	Use with caution in patients with convulsive disorders, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis.
0	Be alert to hypokalemia and hyperglycemia.
0	When LABA are used in fixed<U+2011>dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone.
0	The Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART) was a large 28-week placebo-controlled U.S. trial comparing the safety of salmeterol (SEREVENT Inhalation Aerosol) with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, that showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol.
0	Given the similar basic mechanisms of action of beta2-agonists, the findings seen in the SMART trial are considered a class effect.
0	A 16-week clinical trial performed in the United Kingdom, the Salmeterol Nationwide Surveillance (SNS) trial, showed results similar to the SMART trial.
0	In the SNS trial, the rate of asthma-related death was numerically, though not statistically significantly, greater in subjects with asthma treated with salmeterol (42 mcg twice daily) than those treated with albuterol (180 mcg 4 times daily) added to usual asthma therapy.
0	The SNS and SMART trials enrolled subjects with asthma.
0	Available data do not suggest an increased risk of death with use of LABA in patients with COPD.
0	SEREVENT DISKUS should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma or COPD.
0	SEREVENT DISKUS has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD.
0	The initiation of SEREVENT DISKUS in this setting is not appropriate.
0	Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol has been initiated in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma.
0	In most cases, these have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., patients with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, previous life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma (e.g., patients with significantly increasing symptoms; increasing need for inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists; decreasing response to usual medications; increasing need for systemic corticosteroids; recent emergency room visits; deteriorating lung function).
0	However, these events have occurred in a few patients with less severe asthma as well.
0	It was not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events.
0	Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma.
0	In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the possible need for adding additional ICS or initiating systemic corticosteroids.
0	Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation twice daily of SEREVENT DISKUS.
0	SEREVENT DISKUS should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.
0	An inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist, not SEREVENT DISKUS, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath.
0	When prescribing SEREVENT DISKUS, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms.
0	When beginning treatment with SEREVENT DISKUS, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs.
0	There are no data demonstrating that SEREVENT DISKUS has a clinical anti-inflammatory effect such as that associated with corticosteroids.
0	When initiating and throughout treatment with SEREVENT DISKUS in patients receiving oral or ICS for treatment of asthma, patients must continue taking a suitable dosage of corticosteroids to maintain clinical stability even if they feel better as a result of initiating SEREVENT DISKUS.
0	Any change in corticosteroid dosage should be made ONLY after clinical evaluation.
0	SEREVENT DISKUS should not be used more often than recommended, at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medicines containing LABA, as an overdose may result.
0	Clinically significant cardiovascular effects and fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.
0	Patients using SEREVENT DISKUS should not use another medicine containing a LABA (e.g., formoterol fumarate, arformoterol tartrate, indacaterol) for any reason.
0	As with other inhaled medicines, SEREVENT DISKUS can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening.
0	If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with SEREVENT DISKUS, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; SEREVENT DISKUS should be discontinued immediately; and alternative therapy should be instituted.
0	Upper airway symptoms of laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling, such as stridor and choking, have been reported in patients receiving SEREVENT DISKUS.
0	Excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation has been associated with seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia.
0	Therefore, SEREVENT DISKUS, like all products containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.
0	Salmeterol can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms.
0	Although such effects are uncommon after administration of salmeterol at recommended doses, if they occur, the drug may need to be discontinued.
0	In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression.
0	The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.
0	Large doses of inhaled or oral salmeterol (12 to 20 times the recommended dose) have been associated with clinically significant prolongation of the QTc interval, which has the potential for producing ventricular arrhythmias.
0	Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.
0	Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), including anaphylaxis, may occur after administration of SEREVENT DISKUS.
0	There have been reports of anaphylactic reactions in patients with severe milk protein allergy after inhalation of powder products containing lactose; therefore, patients with severe milk protein allergy should not use SEREVENT DISKUS.
0	The use of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with SEREVENT DISKUS is not recommended because increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur.
0	SEREVENT DISKUS, like all medicines containing sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders or thyrotoxicosis and in those who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.
0	Doses of the related beta2-adrenoceptor agonist albuterol, when administered intravenously, have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.
0	Beta-adrenergic agonist medicines may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects.
0	The decrease in serum potassium is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.
0	Clinically significant and dose-related changes in blood glucose and/or serum potassium were seen infrequently during clinical trials with SEREVENT DISKUS at recommended doses.
0	In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta2-adrenoceptors than albuterol.
0	Although beta2-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1-adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta2-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors.
0	The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but their presence raises the possibility that even selective beta2-agonists may have cardiac effects.
0	The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including salmeterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3<U+2032>,5<U+2032>-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP).
0	Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.
0	In vitro tests show that salmeterol is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandin D2, from human lung.
0	Salmeterol inhibits histamine-induced plasma protein extravasation and inhibits platelet-activating factor<U+2013>induced eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of guinea pigs when administered by the inhaled route.
0	In humans, single doses of salmeterol administered via inhalation aerosol attenuate allergen-induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness.
0	Inhaled salmeterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce dose-related cardiovascular effects and effects on blood glucose and/or serum potassium.
0	The cardiovascular effects (heart rate, blood pressure) associated with salmeterol inhalation aerosol occur with similar frequency, and are of similar type and severity, as those noted following albuterol administration.
0	The effects of rising inhaled doses of salmeterol and standard inhaled doses of albuterol were studied in volunteers and in subjects with asthma.
0	Salmeterol doses up to 84 mcg administered as inhalation aerosol resulted in heart rate increases of 3 to 16 beats/min, about the same as albuterol dosed at 180 mcg by inhalation aerosol (4 to 10 beats/min).
0	Adult and adolescent subjects receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (n = 60) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 1 month of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted.
0	Also, pediatric patients receiving 50-mcg doses of salmeterol inhalation powder (n = 67) underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during two 12-hour periods after the first dose and after 3 months of therapy, and no clinically significant dysrhythmias were noted.
0	In 24-week clinical studies in patients with COPD, the incidence of clinically significant abnormalities on the predose ECGs at Weeks 12 and 24 in patients who received salmeterol 50 mcg was not different compared with placebo.
0	No effect of treatment with salmeterol 50 mcg was observed on pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a subset of patients with COPD who underwent 12-hour serial vital sign measurements after the first dose (n = 91) and after 12 weeks of therapy (n = 74).
0	Median changes from baseline in pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were similar for patients receiving either salmeterol or placebo.
0	Concomitant Use of SEREVENT DISKUS with Other Respiratory Medications Short-acting Beta2-agonists: In two 12-week repetitive-dose clinical trials in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma (N = 149), the mean daily need for additional beta2-agonist in subjects using SEREVENT DISKUS was approximately 1<U+00BD> inhalations/day.
0	Twenty-six percent (26%) of the subjects in these trials used between 8 and 24 inhalations of short-acting beta-agonist per day on 1 or more occasions.
0	Nine percent (9%) of the subjects in these trials averaged over 4 inhalations/day over the course of the 12-week trials.
0	No increase in frequency of cardiovascular events was observed among the 3 subjects who averaged 8 to 11 inhalations/day; however, the safety of concomitant use of more than 8 inhalations/day of short-acting beta2-agonist with SEREVENT DISKUS has not been established.
0	In 29 subjects who experienced worsening of asthma while receiving SEREVENT DISKUS during these trials, albuterol therapy administered via either nebulizer or inhalation aerosol (1 dose in most cases) led to improvement in FEV1 and no increase in occurrence of cardiovascular adverse events.
0	In 2 clinical trials in subjects with COPD, the mean daily need for additional beta2-agonist for subjects using SEREVENT DISKUS was approximately 4 inhalations/day.
0	Twenty-four percent (24%) of subjects using SEREVENT DISKUS averaged 6 or more inhalations of albuterol per day over the course of the 24-week trials.
0	No increase in frequency of cardiovascular adverse reactions was observed among subjects who averaged 6 or more inhalations per day.
0	Methylxanthines: The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered methylxanthines (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline) by subjects receiving salmeterol has not been completely evaluated.
0	In 1 clinical trial in subjects with asthma, 87 subjects receiving SEREVENT Inhalation Aerosol 42 mcg twice daily concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 71 subjects receiving SEREVENT Inhalation Aerosol without theophylline.
0	Resting heart rates were slightly higher in the subjects on theophylline but were little affected by therapy with SEREVENT Inhalation Aerosol.
0	In 2 clinical trials in subjects with COPD, 39 subjects receiving SEREVENT DISKUS concurrently with a theophylline product had adverse event rates similar to those in 302 subjects receiving SEREVENT DISKUS without theophylline.
0	Based on the available data, the concomitant administration of methylxanthines with SEREVENT DISKUS did not alter the observed adverse event profile.
0	Cromoglycate: In clinical trials, inhaled cromolyn sodium did not alter the safety profile of salmeterol when administered concurrently.
0	Salmeterol xinafoate, an ionic salt, dissociates in solution so that the salmeterol and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (xinafoate) moieties are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated independently.
0	Salmeterol acts locally in the lung; therefore, plasma levels do not predict therapeutic effect.
0	Absorption Because of the small therapeutic dose, systemic levels of salmeterol are low or undetectable after inhalation of recommended doses (50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily).
0	Following chronic administration of an inhaled dose of 50 mcg of salmeterol inhalation powder twice daily, salmeterol was detected in plasma within 5 to 45 minutes in 7 subjects with asthma; plasma concentrations were very low, with mean peak concentrations of 167 pg/mL at 20 minutes and no accumulation with repeated doses.
0	Distribution The percentage of salmeterol bound to human plasma proteins averages 96% in vitro over the concentration range of 8 to 7,722 ng of salmeterol base per milliliter, much higher concentrations than those achieved following therapeutic doses of salmeterol.
0	Metabolism Salmeterol base is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, with subsequent elimination predominantly in the feces.
0	No significant amount of unchanged salmeterol base was detected in either urine or feces.
0	An in vitro study using human liver microsomes showed that salmeterol is extensively metabolized to <U+03B1>-hydroxysalmeterol (aliphatic oxidation) by CYP3A4.
0	Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, essentially completely inhibited the formation of <U+03B1>-hydroxysalmeterol in vitro.
0	Elimination In 2 healthy adult subjects who received 1 mg of radiolabeled salmeterol (as salmeterol xinafoate) orally, approximately 25% and 60% of the radiolabeled salmeterol was eliminated in urine and feces, respectively, over a period of 7 days.
0	The terminal elimination half-life was about 5.5 hours (1 volunteer only).
0	The xinafoate moiety has no apparent pharmacologic activity.
0	The xinafoate moiety is highly protein bound (>99%) and has a long elimination half-life of 11 days.
1	Drug Interaction Studies Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4: Ketoconazole: In a placebo-controlled crossover drug interaction trial in 20 healthy male and female subjects, coadministration of salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in a significant increase in plasma salmeterol exposure as determined by a 16-fold increase in AUC (ratio with and without ketoconazole 15.76 [90% CI: 10.66, 23.31]) mainly due to increased bioavailability of the swallowed portion of the dose.
0	Peak plasma salmeterol concentrations were increased by 1.4-fold (90% CI: 1.23, 1.68).
0	Three (3) out of 20 subjects (15%) were withdrawn from salmeterol and ketoconazole coadministration due to beta-agonist<U+2013>mediated systemic effects (2 with QTc prolongation and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia).
0	Coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole did not result in a clinically significant effect on mean heart rate, mean blood potassium, or mean blood glucose.
0	Erythromycin: In a repeat-dose trial in 13 healthy subjects, concomitant administration of erythromycin (a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor) and salmeterol inhalation aerosol resulted in a 40% increase in salmeterol Cmax at steady state (ratio with and without erythromycin 1.4 [90% CI: 0.96, 2.03], P = 0.12), a 3.6-beat/min increase in heart rate ([95% CI: 0.19, 7.03], P<0.04), a 5.8-msec increase in QTc interval ([95% CI: -6.14, 17.77], P = 0.34), and no change in plasma potassium.
0	Ketamine hydrochloride is contraindicated in those in whom a significant elevation of blood pressure would constitute a serious hazard and in those who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug.
0	Note: Barbiturates and KETALAR, being chemically incompatible because of precipitate formation, should not be injected from the same syringe.
0	If the KETALAR dose is augmented with diazepam, the two drugs must be given separately.
0	Do not mix KETALAR and diazepam in syringe or infusion flask.
0	For additional information on the use of diazepam, refer to the WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sections of the diazepam insert.
0	While vomiting has been reported following KETALAR administration, some airway protection may be afforded because of active laryngeal-pharyngeal reflexes.
0	However, since aspiration may occur with KETALAR and since protective reflexes may also be diminished by supplementary anesthetics and muscle relaxants, the possibility of aspiration must be considered.
0	KETALAR is recommended for use in the patient whose stomach is not empty when, in the judgment of the practitioner, the benefits of the drug outweigh the possible risks.
0	Atropine, scopolamine, or another drying agent should be given at an appropriate interval prior to induction.
0	Because of rapid induction following the initial intravenous injection, the patient should be in a supported position during administration.
0	The onset of action of KETALAR is rapid; an intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight usually produces surgical anesthesia within 30 seconds after injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting five to ten minutes.
0	If a longer effect is desired, additional increments can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly to maintain anesthesia without producing significant cumulative effects.
0	Intramuscular doses, in a range of 9 to 13 mg/kg usually produce surgical anesthesia within 3 to 4 minutes following injection, with the anesthetic effect usually lasting 12 to 25 minutes.
0	As with other general anesthetic agents, the individual response to KETALAR is somewhat varied depending on the dose, route of administration, and age of patient, so that dosage recommendation cannot be absolutely fixed.
0	The drug should be titrated against the patient's requirements.
0	In individuals with a history of chronic ketamine use for off-label indications, there have been case reports of genitourinary pain that may be related to the ketamine treatment, not the underlying condition.
0	Consider cessation of ketamine if genitourinary pain continues in the setting of other genitourinary symptoms.
0	Intravenous Route: The initial dose of KETALAR administered intravenously may range from 1 mg/kg to 4.5 mg/kg.
0	The average amount required to produce five to ten minutes of surgical anesthesia has been 2 mg/kg.
0	Alternatively, in adult patients an induction dose of 1 mg to 2 mg/kg intravenous ketamine at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg/min may be used for induction of anesthesia.
0	In addition, diazepam in 2 mg to 5 mg doses, administered in a separate syringe over 60 seconds, may be used.
0	In most cases, 15 mg of intravenous diazepam or less will suffice.
0	The incidence of psychological manifestations during emergence, particularly dream-like observations and emergence delirium, may be reduced by this induction dosage program.
0	Note: The 100 mg/mL concentration of KETALAR should not be injected intravenously without proper dilution.
0	It is recommended the drug be diluted with an equal volume of either Sterile Water for injection, USP, Normal Saline, or 5% Dextrose in Water.
0	Rate of Administration: It is recommended that KETALAR be administered slowly (over a period of 60 seconds).
0	More rapid administration may result in respiratory depression and enhanced pressor response.
0	Intramuscular Route: The initial dose of KETALAR administered intramuscularly may range from 6.5 to 13 mg/kg.
0	A dose of 10 mg/kg will usually produce 12 to 25 minutes of surgical anesthesia.
0	The maintenance dose should be adjusted according to the patient's anesthetic needs and whether an additional anesthetic agent is employed.
0	Increments of one-half to the full induction dose may be repeated as needed for maintenance of anesthesia.
0	However, it should be noted that purposeless and tonic-clonic movements of extremities may occur during the course of anesthesia.
0	These movements do not imply a light plane and are not indicative of the need for additional doses of the anesthetic.
0	It should be recognized that the larger the total dose of KETALAR administered, the longer will be the time to complete recovery.
0	Adult patients induced with KETALAR augmented with intravenous diazepam may be maintained on KETALAR given by slow microdrip infusion technique at a dose of 0.1 to 0.5 mg/minute, augmented with diazepam 2 to 5 mg administered intravenously as needed.
0	In many cases 20 mg or less of intravenous diazepam total for combined induction and maintenance will suffice.
0	However, slightly more diazepam may be required depending on the nature and duration of the operation, physical status of the patient, and other factors.
0	The incidence of psychological manifestations during emergence, particularly dream-like observations and emergence delirium, may be reduced by this maintenance dosage program.
0	Dilution: To prepare a dilute solution containing 1 mg of ketamine per mL, aseptically transfer 10 mL from a 50 mg per mL vial or 5 mL from a 100 mg per mL vial to 500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or Sodium Chloride (0.9%) Injection, USP (Normal Saline) and mix well.
0	The resultant solution will contain 1 mg of ketamine per mL.
0	The fluid requirements of the patient and duration of anesthesia must be considered when selecting the appropriate dilution of KETALAR.
0	If fluid restriction is required, KETALAR can be added to a 250 mL infusion as described above to provide a KETALAR concentration of 2 mg/mL.
0	KETALAR 10 mg/mL vials are not recommended for dilution.
0	KETALAR is clinically compatible with the commonly used general and local anesthetic agents when an adequate respiratory exchange is maintained.
0	The regimen of a reduced dose of KETALAR supplemented with diazepam can be used to produce balanced anesthesia by combination with other agents such as nitrous oxide and oxygen.
0	Prolonged recovery time may occur if barbiturates and/or narcotics are used concurrently with KETALAR.
0	KETALAR should be used by or under the direction of physicians experienced in administering general anesthetics and in maintenance of an airway and in the control of respiration.
0	Because pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes are usually active, KETALAR should not be used alone in surgery or diagnostic procedures of the pharynx, larynx, or bronchial tree.
0	Mechanical stimulation of the pharynx should be avoided, whenever possible, if KETALAR is used alone.
0	Muscle relaxants, with proper attention to respiration, may be required in both of these instances.
0	Resuscitative equipment should be ready for use.
0	The incidence of emergence reactions may be reduced if verbal and tactile stimulation of the patient is minimized during the recovery period.
0	This does not preclude the monitoring of vital signs.
0	The intravenous dose should be administered over a period of 60 seconds.
0	More rapid administration may result in respiratory depression or apnea and enhanced pressor response.
0	In surgical procedures involving visceral pain pathways, KETALAR should be supplemented with an agent which obtunds visceral pain.
0	Use with caution in the chronic alcoholic and the acutely alcohol-intoxicated patient.
0	An increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure has been reported following administration of ketamine hydrochloride.
0	Use with extreme caution in patients with preanesthetic elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure.
0	Carcinogenesis Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ketamine.
0	Mutagenesis In a published report, ketamine was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay.
0	Impairment of Fertility Adequate studies to evaluate the impact of ketamine on male or female fertility have not been conducted.
0	Male and female rats were treated with 10 mg/kg ketamine IV (0.8 times the average human induction dose of 2 mg/kg IV based on body surface area) on Days 11, 10, and 9 prior to mating.
0	No impact on fertility was noted; however, this study design does not adequately characterize the impact of a drug on fertility endpoints.
0	There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of KETALAR in pregnant women.
0	In animal reproduction studies in rats developmental delays (hypoplasia of skeletal tissues) were noted at 0.3 times the human intramuscular dose of 10 mg/kg.
0	In rabbits, developmental delays and increased fetal resorptions were noted at 0.6 times the human dose.
0	Published studies in pregnant primates demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity during the period of peak brain development increases neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring when used for longer than 3 hours.
0	There are no data on pregnancy exposures in primates corresponding to periods prior to the third trimester in humans.
0	The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.
0	All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.
0	In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.
0	Since the safe use in pregnancy, including obstetrics (either vaginal or abdominal delivery), has not been established, such use is not recommended.
0	Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on either Gestation Days 6 to 10 or Gestation Days 11 to 15.
0	Ketamine treatment produced an increased incidence of hypoplastic skull, phalanges, and sternebrae in the pups.
0	Pregnant rabbits were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.6 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on either Gestation Days 6 to 10 or Gestation Days 11 to 15.
0	An increase in resorptions and skeletal hypoplasia of the fetuses were noted.
0	Additional pregnant rabbits were treated intramuscularly with a single dose 60 mg/kg (1.9 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) on Gestation Day 6 only.
0	Skeletal hypoplasia was reported in the fetuses.
0	In a study where pregnant rats were treated intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg ketamine (0.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) from Gestation Day 18 to 21.
0	There was a slight increase in incidence of delayed parturition by one day in treated dams of this group.
0	No adverse effects on the litters or pups were noted; however, learning and memory assessments were not completed.
0	Three pregnant beagle dogs were treated intramuscularly with 25 mg/kg ketamine (1.3 times the human dose of 10 mg/kg IM based on body surface area) twice weekly for the three weeks of the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy, respectively, without the development of adverse effects in the pups.
0	In a published study in primates, administration of an anesthetic dose of ketamine for 24 hours on Gestation Day 122 increased neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the fetus.
0	In other published studies, administration of either isoflurane or propofol for 5 hours on Gestation Day 120 resulted in increased neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring.
0	With respect to brain development, this time period corresponds to the third trimester of gestation in the human.
0	The clinical significance of these findings is not clear; however, studies in juvenile animals suggest neuroapoptosis correlates with long-term cognitive deficits.
0	Risk of Drowsiness As appropriate, especially in cases where early discharge is possible, the duration of KETALAR and other drugs employed during the conduct of anesthesia should be considered.
0	The patients should be cautioned that driving an automobile, operating hazardous machinery or engaging in hazardous activities should not be undertaken for 24 hours or more (depending upon the dosage of KETALAR and consideration of other drugs employed) after anesthesia.
0	Effect of anesthetic and sedation drugs on early brain development Studies conducted in young animals and children suggest repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in children younger than 3 years may have negative effects on their developing brains.
0	Discuss with parents and caregivers the benefits, risks, and timing and duration of surgery or procedures requiring anesthetic and sedation drugs.
0	Clinical studies of ketamine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
0	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
0	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
0	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established.
0	Published juvenile animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs, such as KETALAR, that either block NMDA receptors or potentiate the activity of GABA during the period of rapid brain growth or synaptogenesis, results in widespread neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell loss in the developing brain and alterations in synaptic morphology and neurogenesis.
0	Based on comparisons across species, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.
0	In primates, exposure to 3 hours of ketamine that produced a light surgical plane of anesthesia did not increase neuronal cell loss, however, treatment regimens of 5 hours or longer of isoflurane increased neuronal cell loss.
0	Data from isoflurane-treated rodents and ketamine-treated primates suggest that the neuronal and oligodendrocyte cell losses are associated with prolonged cognitive deficits in learning and memory.
0	The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and healthcare providers should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women, neonates, and young children who require procedures with the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data.
0	Cardiac function should be continually monitored during the procedure in patients found to have hypertension or cardiac decompensation.
0	Postoperative confusional states may occur during the recovery period.
0	Respiratory depression may occur with overdosage or too rapid a rate of administration of KETALAR, in which case supportive ventilation should be employed.
0	Mechanical support of respiration is preferred to administration of analeptics.
0	Published animal studies demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours.
0	The clinical significance of these findings is not clear.
0	However, based on the available data, the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life, but may extend out to approximately three years of age in humans.
0	Some published studies in children suggest that similar deficits may occur after repeated or prolonged exposures to anesthetic agents early in life and may result in adverse cognitive or behavioral effects.
0	These studies have substantial limitations, and it is not clear if the observed effects are due to the anesthetic/sedation drug administration or other factors such as the surgery or underlying illness.
0	Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery, other procedures, or tests that cannot be delayed, and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other.
0	Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.
0	KETALAR is a rapid-acting general anesthetic producing an anesthetic state characterized by profound analgesia, normal pharyngeal-laryngeal reflexes, normal or slightly enhanced skeletal muscle tone, cardiovascular and respiratory stimulation, and occasionally a transient and minimal respiratory depression.
0	The mechanism of action is primarily due to antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA receptors) in the central nervous system.
0	A patent airway is maintained partly by virtue of unimpaired pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes.
0	The biotransformation of KETALAR includes N-dealkylation (metabolite I), hydroxylation of the cyclohexone ring (metabolites III and IV), conjugation with glucuronic acid and dehydration of the hydroxylated metabolites to form the cyclohexene derivative (metabolite II).
0	Following intravenous administration, the ketamine concentration has an initial slope (alpha phase) lasting about 45 minutes with a half-life of 10 to 15 minutes.
0	This first phase corresponds clinically to the anesthetic effect of the drug.
0	The anesthetic action is terminated by a combination of redistribution from the CNS to slower equilibrating peripheral tissues and by hepatic biotransformation to metabolite I.
0	This metabolite is about 1/3 as active as ketamine in reducing halothane requirements (MAC) of the rat.
0	The later half-life of ketamine (beta phase) is 2.5 hours.
0	The anesthetic state produced by KETALAR has been termed dissociative anesthesia in that it appears to selectively interrupt association pathways of the brain before producing somatesthetic sensory blockade.
0	It may selectively depress the thalamoneocortical system before significantly obtunding the more ancient cerebral centers and pathways (reticular-activating and limbic systems).
0	Elevation of blood pressure begins shortly after injection, reaches a maximum within a few minutes and usually returns to preanesthetic values within 15 minutes after injection.
0	In the majority of cases, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure peaks from 10% to 50% above preanesthetic levels shortly after induction of anesthesia, but the elevation can be higher or longer in individual cases.
0	Ketamine has a wide margin of safety; several instances of unintentional administration of overdoses of KETALAR (up to ten times that usually required) have been followed by prolonged but complete recovery.
0	KETALAR has been studied in over 12,000 operative and diagnostic procedures, involving over 10,000 patients from 105 separate studies.
0	During the course of these studies KETALAR was administered as the sole agent, as induction for other general agents, or to supplement low-potency agents.
0	Specific areas of application have included the following: 1. debridement, painful dressings, and skin grafting in burn patients, as well as other superficial surgical procedures.
0	2. neurodiagnostic procedures such as pneumonencephalograms, ventriculograms, myelograms, and lumbar punctures.
0	See also Precaution concerning increased intracranial pressure.
0	3. diagnostic and operative procedures of the eye, ear, nose, and mouth, including dental extractions.
0	4. diagnostic and operative procedures of the pharynx, larynx, or bronchial tree.
0	NOTE: Muscle relaxants, with proper attention to respiration, may be required.
0	5. sigmoidoscopy and minor surgery of the anus and rectum, and circumcision.
0	6. extraperitoneal procedures used in gynecology such as dilatation and curettage.
0	7. orthopedic procedures such as closed reductions, manipulations, femoral pinning, amputations, and biopsies.
0	8. as an anesthetic in poor-risk patients with depression of vital functions.
0	9. in procedures where the intramuscular route of administration is preferred.
0	10. in cardiac catheterization procedures.
0	In these studies, the anesthesia was rated either excellent or good by the anesthesiologist and the surgeon at 90% and 93%, respectively; rated fair at 6% and 4%, respectively; and rated poor at 4% and 3%, respectively.
0	In a second method of evaluation, the anesthesia was rated adequate in at least 90%, and inadequate in 10% or less of the procedures.
0	Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or acute episodes of asthma requiring intensive measures.
0	Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of ASMANEX HFA.
0	ASMANEX HFA is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.
0	ASMANEX HFA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to mometasone furoate or any of the ingredients in ASMANEX HFA.
0	Treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older: 2 inhalations twice daily of ASMANEX HFA 100 mcg or 200 mcg.
0	Starting dosage is based on prior asthma therapy.
0	ASMANEX HFA should be administered only by the orally inhaled route.
0	After each dose, the patient should be advised to rinse his/her mouth with water without swallowing.
0	The cap from the mouthpiece of the actuator should be removed before using ASMANEX HFA.
0	ASMANEX HFA should be primed before using for the first time by releasing 4 test sprays into the air, away from the face, shaking well before each spray.
0	In cases where the inhaler has not been used for more than 5 days, prime the inhaler again by releasing 4 test sprays into the air, away from the face, shaking well before each spray.
0	The ASMANEX HFA canister should only be used with the ASMANEX HFA actuator.
0	The ASMANEX HFA actuator should not be used with any other inhalation drug product.
0	Actuators from other products should not be used with the ASMANEX HFA canister.
0	ASMANEX HFA should be administered as two inhalations twice daily every day (morning and evening) by the orally inhaled route.
0	The recommended doses for ASMANEX HFA treatment based on prior asthma therapy are provided in Table 1.
0	TABLE 1: Recommended Dosages for ASMANEX HFA Treatment Previous Therapy Recommended Dose Inhaled medium-dose corticosteroids ASMANEX HFA 100 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily Inhaled high-dose corticosteroids ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily Oral corticosteroids For Patients Currently Receiving Chronic Oral Corticosteroid Therapy: Prednisone should be weaned slowly, beginning after at least 1 week of ASMANEX HFA therapy.
0	Monitor patients carefully for signs of asthma instability, including serial objective measures of airflow, and for signs of adrenal insufficiency during steroid taper and following discontinuation of oral corticosteroid therapy.
0	ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg, 2 inhalations twice daily If a dosage regimen of ASMANEX HFA fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options, e.g., replacing the current strength of ASMANEX HFA with a higher strength, initiating an inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta2-agonist combination product, or initiating oral corticosteroids, should be considered.
0	The maximum daily recommended dose is two inhalations of ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg twice daily (maximum of 800 mcg a day).
0	If symptoms arise between doses, an inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist should be taken for immediate relief.
0	The maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after beginning treatment.
0	Individual patients may experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.
0	For patients who do not respond adequately after 2 weeks of therapy, higher strength may provide additional asthma control.
0	After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects.
0	In clinical trials, concurrent administration of ASMANEX HFA and other drugs, such as short-acting beta2-agonist and intranasal corticosteroids have not resulted in an increased frequency of adverse drug reactions.
0	No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with ASMANEX HFA.
0	Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir): Use with caution.
0	May cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects.
0	The main route of metabolism of corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate, is via CYP3A4.
1	After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally inhaled mometasone furoate increased.
0	Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, mometasone furoate and potentially increase the risk for systemic corticosteroid side effects.
0	Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ASMANEX HFA with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin).
0	Consider the benefit of coadministration versus the potential risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side effects.
0	Deterioration of asthma and acute episodes: ASMANEX HFA should not be used for relief of acute symptoms.
0	Patients require immediate re-evaluation during rapidly deteriorating asthma.
0	Localized infections: Candida albicans infection of the mouth and throat may occur.
0	Monitor patients periodically for signs of adverse effects on the oral cavity.
0	Advise patients to rinse the mouth following inhalation.
0	Immunosuppression: Potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection; or ocular herpes simplex infections.
0	More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients.
0	Use with caution in patients with these infections because of the potential for worsening of these infections.
0	Transferring patients from systemic corticosteroids: Risk of impaired adrenal function when transferring from oral steroids.
0	Wean patients slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to ASMANEX HFA.
0	Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression: May occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals.
0	If such changes occur, discontinue ASMANEX HFA slowly.
0	Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir): Risk of increased systemic corticosteroid effects.
0	Exercise caution when used with ASMANEX HFA.
0	Paradoxical bronchospasm: Discontinue ASMANEX HFA and institute alternative therapy if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs.
0	Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis: Hypersensitivity reactions, such as urticaria, flushing, allergic dermatitis, bronchospasm, rash, pruritus, angioedema, and anaphylactic reaction may occur.
0	Discontinue ASMANEX HFA if such reactions occur.
0	Decreases in bone mineral density: Monitor patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content.
0	Effects on growth: Monitor growth of pediatric patients.
0	Glaucoma and cataracts: Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use ASMANEX HFA long term.
0	ASMANEX HFA is not indicated for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.
0	An inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist, not ASMANEX HFA, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath.
0	When prescribing ASMANEX HFA, the physician must also provide the patient with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice-daily (morning and evening) use of ASMANEX HFA.
0	Instruct patients to contact their physician immediately if episodes of asthma that are not responsive to bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with ASMANEX HFA.
0	During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids.
0	In clinical trials, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with Candida albicans have occurred in patients treated with ASMANEX HFA.
0	If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while remaining on treatment with ASMANEX HFA therapy, but at times therapy with ASMANEX HFA may need to be interrupted.
0	Advise patients to rinse the mouth after inhalation of ASMANEX HFA.
0	Persons who are using drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals.
0	Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids.
0	In such children or adults who have not had these diseases or who are not properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure.
0	How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known.
0	The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known.
0	If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be indicated.
0	If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated.
0	If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.
0	Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract, untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex.
0	Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to ASMANEX HFA because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids.
0	After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function.
0	Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn.
0	During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss.
0	Although ASMANEX HFA may improve control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of corticosteroid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity necessary for coping with these emergencies.
0	During periods of stress or severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction.
0	These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or severe asthma attack.
0	Patients requiring oral or other systemic corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from oral or other systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to ASMANEX HFA.
0	Lung function (FEV1 or PEF), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral or other systemic corticosteroids.
0	In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension.
0	Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to ASMANEX HFA may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy, e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions.
0	During withdrawal from oral corticosteroids, some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function.
0	ASMANEX HFA will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone.
0	Since mometasone furoate is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of ASMANEX HFA in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose.
0	Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with ASMANEX HFA should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects.
0	Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.
0	It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when mometasone furoate is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time.
0	If such effects occur, the dosage of ASMANEX HFA should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms.
1	Caution should be exercised when considering the coadministration of ASMANEX HFA with ketoconazole, and other known strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to mometasone furoate may occur.
0	ASMANEX HFA may produce inhalation induced bronchospasm with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing that may be life-threatening.
0	If inhalation induced bronchospasm occurs, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator.
0	ASMANEX HFA should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.
0	Hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, flushing, allergic dermatitis, and bronchospasm, may occur after administration of ASMANEX HFA.
0	The following additional hypersensitivity reactions, such as rash, pruritus, angioedema, and anaphylactic reaction, have been reported after administration of mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler.
0	Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate.
0	The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term outcomes, such as fracture, is unknown.
0	Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants and corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care.
0	In a 2-year double-blind study in 103 male and female asthma patients 18 to 50 years of age previously maintained on bronchodilator therapy (Baseline FEV1 85%-88% predicted), treatment with mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler 200 mcg twice daily resulted in significant reductions in lumbar spine (LS) BMD at the end of the treatment period compared to placebo.
0	The mean change from Baseline to Endpoint in the lumbar spine BMD was -0.015 (-1.43%) for the mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler group compared to 0.002 (0.25%) for the placebo group.
0	In another 2-year double-blind study in 87 male and female asthma patients 18 to 50 years of age previously maintained on bronchodilator therapy (Baseline FEV1 82%-83% predicted), treatment with mometasone furoate dry powder inhaler 400 mcg twice daily demonstrated no statistically significant changes in lumbar spine BMD at the end of the treatment period compared to placebo.
0	The mean change from Baseline to Endpoint in the lumbar spine BMD was -0.018 (-1.57%) for the mometasone furoate group compared to -0.006 (-0.43%) for the placebo group.
0	Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ASMANEX HFA, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients.
0	Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving ASMANEX HFA routinely (e.g., via stadiometry).
0	To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including ASMANEX HFA, titrate each patient's dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms.
0	Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the use of long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including mometasone furoate.
0	Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use ASMANEX HFA long term.
0	Mometasone furoate is a corticosteroid demonstrating potent anti-inflammatory activity.
0	The precise mechanism of corticosteroid action on asthma is not known.
0	Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma.
0	Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of inhibitory effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in inflammation and in the asthmatic response.
0	These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma.
0	Mometasone furoate has been shown in vitro to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor, which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone.
0	The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.
0	HPA Axis Effects The effects of inhaled mometasone furoate administered via ASMANEX HFA on adrenal function have not been directly evaluated.
0	However, the effects of inhaled mometasone furoate, administered as part of a mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate inhalation aerosol combination product, on adrenal function were evaluated in two clinical trials in patients with asthma.
0	As no evidence of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between mometasone furoate and formoterol was observed when the two drugs were administered in combination, the HPA axis effects from the combination product are applicable to ASMANEX HFA.
0	For the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate combination product clinical program, HPA-axis function was assessed by 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC.
0	Although both these trials have open-label design and contain a small number of subjects per treatment arm, results from these trials taken together demonstrated suppression of 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC for the combination mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg compared to placebo consistent with the known systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroid.
0	In a 42-day, open-label, placebo- and active-controlled study, the mean change from baseline plasma cortisol AUC(0-24 hr) was 8%, 22% and 34% lower compared to placebo for the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 100 mcg/5 mcg (n=13), mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg (n=15) and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 230 mcg/21 mcg (n=16) treatment groups, respectively.
0	In a 52-week, open-label safety study, the mean plasma cortisol AUC(0-24 hr) was 2.2%, 29.6%, 16.7%, and 32.2% lower from baseline for the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 100 mcg/5 mcg (n=18), mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 200 mcg/5 mcg (n=20), fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 125/25 mcg (n=8), and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate 250/25 mcg (n=11) treatment groups, respectively.
0	The potential effect of mometasone furoate via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) on the HPA axis was also assessed in a 29-day study.
0	A total of 64 adult patients with mild to moderate asthma were randomized to one of 4 treatment groups: mometasone furoate DPI 440 mcg twice daily, mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily, oral prednisone 10 mg once daily, or placebo.
0	The 30-minute post-Cosyntropin stimulation serum cortisol concentration on Day 29 was 23.2 mcg/dL for the mometasone furoate DPI 440 mcg twice daily group and 20.8 mcg/dL for the mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily group, compared to 14.5 mcg/dL for the oral prednisone 10 mg group and 25 mcg/dL for the placebo group.
0	The difference between mometasone furoate DPI 880 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) and placebo was statistically significant.
0	As no evidence of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction between mometasone furoate and formoterol was observed when the two drugs were administered from a mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate combination product, the pharmacokinetics information from the combination product is applicable to ASMANEX HFA.
0	Absorption Healthy Subjects: Following oral inhalation of single doses of ASMANEX HFA, mometasone furoate was absorbed in healthy subjects with median Tmax values ranging from 0.50 to 2 hours.
0	Following single-dose administration of higher than recommended dose of ASMANEX HFA (4 inhalations of ASMANEX HFA 200 mcg) in healthy subjects, the arithmetic mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC(0-tf) values for mometasone furoate were 53 (102) pg/mL and 992 (80) pg<U+2219>hr/mL, respectively.
0	Studies using oral dosing of labeled and unlabeled drug have demonstrated that the oral systemic bioavailability of mometasone furoate is negligible (<1%).
0	Asthma Patients: Following oral inhalation of single and multiple doses of the mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate combination product, mometasone furoate was absorbed in asthma patients with median Tmax values ranging from 1 to 2 hours.
0	Following single-dose administration of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 400 mcg/10 mcg, the arithmetic mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC(0-12 hr) values for mometasone furoate were 20 (88) pg/mL and 170 (94) pg<U+2219>hr/mL, respectively, while the corresponding estimates following twice daily dosing of mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate 400 mcg/10 mcg at steady-state were 60 (36) pg/mL and 577 (40) pg<U+2219>hr/mL.
0	Distribution Based on the study employing a 1000 mcg inhaled dose of tritiated mometasone furoate inhalation powder in humans, no appreciable accumulation of mometasone furoate in the red blood cells was found.

0	Free hormone concentrations, such as testosterone and estradiol, may be decreased.
0	Other plasma proteins may be increased (angiotensinogen/renin substrate, alpha-1-antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin).
0	Increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations, reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations, increased triglyceride levels.
0	Data from a single-dose drug-drug interaction study involving conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate indicate that the pharmacokinetic disposition of both drugs is not altered when the drugs are coadministered.
0	No other clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with conjugated estrogens.
0	Inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism (7.1) In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).
0	Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism.
0	Inducers of CYP3A4, such as St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin, may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile.
1	Inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice, may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.
0	Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease (5.4) Discontinue estrogen if severe hypercalcemia, loss of vision, severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs (5.5, 5.6, 5.11, 5.12) Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy (5.13, 5.18) An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy.
0	An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy.
0	Should any of these events occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.
0	Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (for example, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (for example, personal or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.
0	Stroke In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years).
0	The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted.
0	Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.
0	Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years).1 In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years).
0	The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted.1 Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.
0	Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, no overall effect on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, or CHD death) was reported in women receiving estrogen-alone compared to placebo2.
0	Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non-significant reduction in CHD events (CE [0.625 mg]-alone compared to placebo) in women with less than 10 years since menopause (8 versus 16 per 10,000 women-years).1 In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, there was a statistically non-significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (41 versus 34 per 10,000 women-years).1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1, and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5.
0	In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease (n = 2,763, average 66.7 years of age), in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study; HERS), treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit.
0	During an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD.
0	There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA-treated group than in the placebo group in year 1, but not during the subsequent years.
0	Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-one (2,321) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS, HERS II.
0	Average follow-up in HERS II was an additional 2.7 years, for a total of 6.8 years overall.
0	Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group and the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, and overall.
0	Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, the risk of VTE (DVT and PE), was increased for women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to placebo (30 versus 22 per 10,000 women-years), although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance (23 versus 15 per 10,000 women-years).
0	The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3.
0	Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen-alone therapy should be discontinued immediately.
0	In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant 2-fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women receiving placebo (35 versus 17 per 10,000 women-years).
0	Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT (26 versus 13 per 10,000 women-years) and PE (18 versus 8 per 10,000 women-years) were also demonstrated.
0	The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4.
0	Should a VTE occur or be suspected, estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.
0	If feasible, estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, or during periods of prolonged immobilization.
0	Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus.
0	The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non-users, and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose.
0	Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year.
0	The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use, with increased risks of 15- to 24-fold for 5 to 10 years or more, and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued.
0	Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important.
0	There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose.
0	Adding a progestin to postmenopausal estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.
0	Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen-alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone.
0	In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, after an average follow-up of 7.1 years, daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [relative risk (RR) 0.80] 5.
0	The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg).
0	After a mean follow-up of 5.6 years, the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA.
0	In this substudy, prior use of estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women.
0	The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.24, and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10,000 women-years, for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.6 Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.86, and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.
0	Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy, the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1.09, and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10,000 women-years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo.
0	In the same substudy, invasive breast cancers were larger, were more likely to be node positive, and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) group compared with the placebo group.
0	Metastatic disease was rare, with no apparent difference between the two groups.
0	Other prognostic factors, such as histologic subtype, grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups.
0	Consistent with the WHI clinical trial, observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy, and a smaller increased risk for estrogen-alone therapy, after several years of use.
0	The risk increased with duration of use, and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment (only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping).
0	Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen-alone therapy.
0	However, these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations, doses, or routes of administration.
0	The use of estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms, requiring further evaluation.
0	All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self-examinations.
0	In addition, mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age, risk factors, and prior mammogram results.
0	Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non-significant increased risk of ovarian cancer.
0	After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95 percent CI 0.77<U+2013>3.24).
0	The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10,000 women-years.7 A meta-analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer.
0	The primary analysis, using case-control comparisons, included 12,110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies.
0	The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1.41 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32 to 1.50); there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure (less than 5 years [median of 3 years] vs. greater than 5 years [median of 10 years] of use before the cancer diagnosis).
0	The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use (discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis) was 1.37 (95% CI 1.27<U+2013>1.48), and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin products.
0	The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, however, is unknown.
0	In the WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI, a population of 2,947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone or placebo.
0	After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, 28 women in the estrogen-alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia.
0	The relative risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI 0.83<U+2013>2.66).
0	The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE-alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years8.
0	In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI, a population of 4,532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) or placebo.
0	After an average follow-up of 4 years, 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia.
0	The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2.05 (95 percent CI 1.21<U+2013>3.48).
0	The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10,000 women-years8.
0	When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI 1.19<U+2013>2.60).
0	Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8.
0	A 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported.
0	Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases.
0	If hypercalcemia occurs, use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level.
0	Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens.
0	Discontinue medication pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine.
0	If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions, estrogens should be permanently discontinued.
0	Cases of anaphylaxis, which developed within minutes to hours after taking PREMARIN and require emergency medical management, have been reported in the postmarketing setting.
0	Skin (hives, pruritis, swollen lips-tongue-face) and either respiratory tract (respiratory compromise) or gastrointestinal tract (abdominal pain, vomiting) involvement has been noted.
0	Angioedema involving the tongue, larynx, face, hands, and feet requiring medical intervention has occurred postmarketing in patients taking PREMARIN.
0	If angioedema involves the tongue, glottis, or larynx, airway obstruction may occur.
0	Patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction with or without angioedema after treatment with PREMARIN should not receive PREMARIN again.
0	Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone.
0	Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.
0	There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens.
0	These include an increased risk of breast cancer.
0	In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens.
0	In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen.
0	In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis.
0	Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.
0	Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.
0	For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised, and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.
0	Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels.
0	Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range.
0	Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy.
0	These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.
0	Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention.
0	Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogen alone is prescribed.
0	Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in individuals with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.
0	Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema.
0	A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy.
0	For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.
0	Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.
0	Serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy.
0	Laboratory parameters may be useful in guiding dosage for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration and primary ovarian failure.
0	Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics.
0	Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.
0	The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle.
0	After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues.
0	Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.
0	Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues.
0	To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified.
0	These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.
0	Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism.
0	Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these gonadotropins seen in postmenopausal women.
0	There are no pharmacodynamic data for PREMARIN.
0	Absorption Conjugated estrogens are water-soluble and are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after release from the drug formulation.
0	The PREMARIN tablet releases conjugated estrogens slowly over several hours.
0	Table 2 summarizes the mean pharmacokinetic parameters for unconjugated and conjugated estrogens following administration of 1 <U+00C3><U+2014> 0.625 mg and 1 <U+00C3><U+2014> 1.25 mg tablets to healthy postmenopausal women.
0	Food effect: The pharmacokinetics of PREMARIN 0.45 mg and 1.25 mg tablets were assessed following a single dose with a high-fat breakfast and with fasting administration.
0	The Cmax and AUC of estrogens were altered approximately 3<U+2013>13%.
0	The changes to Cmax and AUC are not considered clinically meaningful, therefore PREMARIN may be taken without regard to meals.

0	Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentration in the sex hormone target organs.
0	Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.
0	Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens.
0	Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions.
0	These transformations take place mainly in the liver.
0	Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both can be converted to estriol, which is a major urinary metabolite.
0	Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine, and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption.
0	In postmenopausal women, a significant portion of the circulating estrogens exists as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate, which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens.
0	Excretion Estradiol, estrone, and estriol are excreted in the urine, along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.
0	Use in Specific Populations No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with Premarin in specific populations, including patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
0	PRECOSE is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
0	Precose is contraindicated in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or cirrhosis.
0	PRECOSE is also contraindicated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, partial intestinal obstruction or in patients predisposed to intestinal obstruction.
0	In addition, PRECOSE is contraindicated in patients who have chronic intestinal diseases associated with marked disorders of digestion or absorption and in patients who have conditions that may deteriorate as a result of increased gas formation in the intestine.
0	There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with PRECOSE or any other pharmacologic agent.
0	Dosage of PRECOSE must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance while not exceeding the maximum recommended dose of 100 mg t.i.d.
0	PRECOSE should be taken three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal.
0	PRECOSE should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation as described below, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient.
0	If the prescribed diet is not observed, the intestinal side effects may be intensified.
0	If strongly distressing symptoms develop in spite of adherence to the diabetic diet prescribed, the doctor must be consulted and the dose temporarily or permanently reduced.
0	During treatment initiation and dose titration, one-hour postprandial plasma glucose may be used to determine the therapeutic response to PRECOSE and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient.
0	Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months.
0	The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both postprandial plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of PRECOSE, either as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin.
0	The recommended starting dosage of PRECOSE is 25 mg given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal.
0	However, some patients may benefit from more gradual dose titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
0	This may be achieved by initiating treatment at 25 mg once per day and subsequently increasing the frequency of administration to achieve 25 mg t.i.d.
0	Once a 25 mg t.i.d. dosage regimen is reached, dosage of PRECOSE should be adjusted at 4<U+2013>8 week intervals based on one-hour postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and on tolerance.
0	The dosage can be increased from 25 mg t.i.d. to 50 mg t.i.d.
0	Some patients may benefit from further increasing the dosage to 100 mg t.i.d.
0	The maintenance dose ranges from 50 mg t.i.d. to 100 mg t.i.d.
0	However, since patients with low body weight may be at increased risk for elevated serum transaminases, only patients with body weight > 60 kg should be considered for dose titration above 50 mg t.i.d.
0	If no further reduction in postprandial glucose or glycosylated hemoglobin levels is observed with titration to 100 mg t.i.d., consideration should be given to lowering the dose.
0	Once an effective and tolerated dosage is established, it should be maintained.
0	The maximum recommended dose for patients <U+2264> 60 kg is 50 mg t.i.d.
0	The maximum recommended dose for patients > 60 kg is 100 mg t.i.d.
0	Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia.
0	PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia.
0	If hypoglycemia occurs, appropriate adjustments in the dosage of these agents should be made.
0	Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of blood glucose control.
0	These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel-blocking drugs, and isoniazid.
0	When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving PRECOSE, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control.
0	When such drugs are withdrawn from patients receiving PRECOSE in combination with sulfonylureas or insulin, patients should be observed closely for any evidence of hypoglycemia.
0	Patients Receiving Sulfonylureas or Insulin: Sulfonylurea agents or insulin may cause hypoglycemia.
0	PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin may cause a further lowering of blood glucose and may increase the potential for hypoglycemia.
0	Very rarely, individual cases of hypoglycemic shock have been reported in patients receiving PRECOSE therapy in combination with sulfonylureas and/or insulin.
0	Intestinal adsorbents (for example, charcoal) and digestive enzyme preparations containing carbohydrate-splitting enzymes (for example, amylase, pancreatin) may reduce the effect of PRECOSE and should not be taken concomitantly.
0	PRECOSE has been shown to change the bioavailability of digoxin when they are coadministered, which may require digoxin dose adjustment.
0	(See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Drug-Drug Interactions.
0	There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with PRECOSE or any other anti-diabetic drug.
0	Hypoglycemia Because of its mechanism of action, PRECOSE when administered alone should not cause hypoglycemia in the fasted or postprandial state.
0	Because PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood glucose, it may increase the potential for hypoglycemia.
0	Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients receiving metformin alone under usual circumstances of use, and no increased incidence of hypoglycemia was observed in patients when PRECOSE was added to metformin therapy.
0	Oral glucose (dextrose), whose absorption is not inhibited by PRECOSE, should be used instead of sucrose (cane sugar) in the treatment of mild to moderate hypoglycemia.
0	Sucrose, whose hydrolysis to glucose and fructose is inhibited by PRECOSE, is unsuitable for the rapid correction of hypoglycemia.
0	Severe hypoglycemia may require the use of either intravenous glucose infusion or glucagon injection.
0	In long-term studies (up to 12 months, and including PRECOSE doses up to 300 mg t.i.d.) conducted in the United States, treatment-emergent elevations of serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT) above the upper limit of normal (ULN), greater than 1.8 times the ULN, and greater than 3 times the ULN occurred in 14%, 6%, and 3%, respectively, of PRECOSE-treated patients as compared to 7%, 2%, and 1%, respectively, of placebo-treated patients.
0	Although these differences between treatments were statistically significant, these elevations were asymptomatic, reversible, more common in females, and, in general, were not associated with other evidence of liver dysfunction.
0	In addition, these serum transaminase elevations appeared to be dose related.
0	In US studies including PRECOSE doses up to the maximum approved dose of 100 mg t.i.d., treatment-emergent elevations of AST and/or ALT at any level of severity were similar between PRECOSE-treated patients and placebo-treated patients (p <U+2265> 0.496).
0	In approximately 3 million patient-years of international postmarketing experience with PRECOSE, 62 cases of serum transaminase elevations > 500 IU/L (29 of which were associated with jaundice) have been reported.
0	Forty-one of these 62 patients received treatment with 100 mg t.i.d. or greater and 33 of 45 patients for whom weight was reported weighed < 60 kg.
0	In the 59 cases where follow-up was recorded, hepatic abnormalities improved or resolved upon discontinuation of PRECOSE in 55 and were unchanged in two.
0	Cases of fulminant hepatitis with fatal outcome have been reported; the relationship to acarbose is unclear.
0	When diabetic patients are exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a temporary loss of control of blood glucose may occur.
0	At such times, temporary insulin therapy may be necessary.
0	Patients should be told to take PRECOSE orally three times a day at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal.
0	It is important that patients continue to adhere to dietary instructions, a regular exercise program, and regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.
0	PRECOSE itself does not cause hypoglycemia even when administered to patients in the fasted state.
0	Sulfonylurea drugs and insulin, however, can lower blood sugar levels enough to cause symptoms or sometimes life-threatening hypoglycemia.
0	Because PRECOSE given in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin will cause a further lowering of blood sugar, it may increase the hypoglycemic potential of these agents.
0	The risk of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be well understood by patients and responsible family members.
0	Because PRECOSE prevents the breakdown of table sugar, patients should have a readily available source of glucose (dextrose, D-glucose) to treat symptoms of low blood sugar when taking PRECOSE in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin.
0	If side effects occur with PRECOSE, they usually develop during the first few weeks of therapy.
0	They are most commonly mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal effects, such as flatulence, diarrhea, or abdominal discomfort, and generally diminish in frequency and intensity with time.
0	Therapeutic response to PRECOSE should be monitored by periodic blood glucose tests.
0	Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin levels is recommended for the monitoring of long-term glycemic control.
0	PRECOSE, particularly at doses in excess of 50 mg t.i.d., may give rise to elevations of serum transaminases and, in rare instances, hyperbilirubinemia.
0	It is recommended that serum transaminase levels be checked every 3 months during the first year of treatment with PRECOSE and periodically thereafter.
0	If elevated transaminases are observed, a reduction in dosage or withdrawal of therapy may be indicated, particularly if the elevations persist.
0	Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking acarbose.
0	Use alternative methods to monitor for glycemic control.
0	Plasma concentrations of PRECOSE in renally impaired volunteers were proportionally increased relative to the degree of renal dysfunction.
0	Long-term clinical trials in diabetic patients with significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2.0 mg/dL) have not been conducted.
0	Therefore, treatment of these patients with PRECOSE is not recommended.
0	Eight carcinogenicity studies were conducted with acarbose.
0	Six studies were performed in rats (two strains, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar) and two studies were performed in hamsters.
0	In the first rat study, Sprague-Dawley rats received acarbose in feed at high doses (up to approximately 500 mg/kg body weight) for 104 weeks.
0	Acarbose treatment resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of renal tumors (adenomas and adenocarcinomas) and benign Leydig cell tumors.
0	This study was repeated with a similar outcome.
0	Further studies were performed to separate direct carcinogenic effects of acarbose from indirect effects resulting from the carbohydrate malnutrition induced by the large doses of acarbose employed in the studies.
0	In one study using Sprague-Dawley rats, acarbose was mixed with feed but carbohydrate deprivation was prevented by the addition of glucose to the diet.
0	In a 26-month study of Sprague-Dawley rats, acarbose was administered by daily postprandial gavage so as to avoid the pharmacologic effects of the drug.
0	In both of these studies, the increased incidence of renal tumors found in the original studies did not occur.
0	Acarbose was also given in food and by postprandial gavage in two separate studies in Wistar rats.
0	No increased incidence of renal tumors was found in either of these Wistar rat studies.
0	In two feeding studies of hamsters, with and without glucose supplementation, there was also no evidence of carcinogenicity.
0	Acarbose did not induce any DNA damage in vitro in the CHO chromosomal aberration assay, bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, or a DNA binding assay.
0	In vivo, no DNA damage was detected in the dominant lethal test in male mice, or the mouse micronucleus test.
0	Fertility studies conducted in rats after oral administration produced no untoward effect on fertility or on the overall capability to reproduce.
0	The safety of PRECOSE in pregnant women has not been established.
0	Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 480 mg/kg (corresponding to 9 times the exposure in humans, based on drug blood levels) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to acarbose.
0	In rabbits, reduced maternal body weight gain, probably the result of the pharmacodynamic activity of high doses of acarbose in the intestines, may have been responsible for a slight increase in the number of embryonic losses.
0	However, rabbits given 160 mg/kg acarbose (corresponding to 10 times the dose in man, based on body surface area) showed no evidence of embryotoxicity and there was no evidence of teratogenicity at a dose 32 times the dose in man (based on body surface area).
0	There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies of PRECOSE in pregnant women.
0	Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
0	Because current information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital anomalies as well as increased neonatal morbidity and mortality, most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.
0	A small amount of radioactivity has been found in the milk of lactating rats after administration of radiolabeled acarbose.
0	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
0	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, PRECOSE should not be administered to a nursing woman.
0	Safety and effectiveness of PRECOSE in pediatric patients have not been established.
0	Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of PRECOSE in the United States, 27% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over.
0	No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects.
0	The mean steady-state area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentrations of acarbose were approximately 1.5 times higher in elderly compared to young volunteers; however, these differences were not statistically significant.
0	Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates,thereby resulting in a smaller rise in blood glucose concentration following meals.
0	As a consequence of plasma glucose reduction, PRECOSE reduces levels of glycosylated hemoglobin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
0	Systemic non-enzymatic protein glycosylation, as reflected by levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, is a function of average blood glucose concentration over time.
0	In contrast to sulfonylureas, PRECOSE does not enhance insulin secretion.
0	The antihyperglycemic action of acarbose results from a competitive, reversible inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucoside hydrolase enzymes.
0	Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, while the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the brush border of the small intestine.
0	In diabetic patients, this enzyme inhibition results in a delayed glucose absorption and a lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia.
0	Because its mechanism of action is different, the effect of PRECOSE to enhance glycemic control is additive to that of sulfonylureas, insulin or metformin when used in combination.
0	In addition, PRECOSE diminishes the insulinotropic and weight-increasing effects of sulfonylureas.
0	Acarbose has no inhibitory activity against lactase and consequently would not be expected to induce lactose intolerance.
0	In a study of 6 healthy men, less than 2% of an oral dose of acarbose was absorbed as active drug, while approximately 35% of total radioactivity from a 14C-labeled oral dose was absorbed.
0	An average of 51% of an oral dose was excreted in the feces as unabsorbed drug-related radioactivity within 96 hours of ingestion.
0	Because acarbose acts locally within the gastrointestinal tract, this low systemic bioavailability of parent compound is therapeutically desired.
0	Following oral dosing of healthy volunteers with 14C-labeled acarbose, peak plasma concentrations of radioactivity were attained 14<U+2013>24 hours after dosing, while peak plasma concentrations of active drug were attained at approximately 1 hour.
0	The delayed absorption of acarbose-related radioactivity reflects the absorption of metabolites that may be formed by either intestinal bacteria or intestinal enzymatic hydrolysis.
0	Acarbose is metabolized exclusively within the gastrointestinal tract, principally by intestinal bacteria, but also by digestive enzymes.
0	A fraction of these metabolites (approximately 34% of the dose) was absorbed and subsequently excreted in the urine.
0	At least 13 metabolites have been separated chromatographically from urine specimens.
0	The major metabolites have been identified as 4-methylpyrogallol derivatives (that is, sulfate, methyl, and glucuronide conjugates).
0	One metabolite (formed by cleavage of a glucose molecule from acarbose) also has alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity.
0	This metabolite, together with the parent compound, recovered from the urine, accounts for less than 2% of the total administered dose.
0	The fraction of acarbose that is absorbed as intact drug is almost completely excreted by the kidneys.
0	When acarbose was given intravenously, 89% of the dose was recovered in the urine as active drug within 48 hours.
0	In contrast, less than 2% of an oral dose was recovered in the urine as active (that is, parent compound and active metabolite) drug.
0	This is consistent with the low bioavailability of the parent drug.
0	The plasma elimination half-life of acarbose activity is approximately 2 hours in healthy volunteers.
0	Consequently, drug accumulation does not occur with three times a day (t.i.d.)
0	Patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr < 25 mL/min/1.73m2) attained about 5 times higher peak plasma concentrations of acarbose and 6 times larger AUCs than volunteers with normal renal function.
0	No studies of acarbose pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed.
0	In U.S. controlled clinical studies of PRECOSE in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin levels were similar in Caucasians (n=478) and African-Americans (n=167), with a trend toward a better response in Latinos (n=132).
0	Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that PRECOSE has no effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of nifedipine, propranolol, or ranitidine.
0	PRECOSE did not interfere with the absorption or disposition of the sulfonylurea glyburide in diabetic patients.
1	PRECOSE may affect digoxin bioavailability and may require dose adjustment of digoxin by 16% (90% confidence interval: 8-23%), decrease mean Cmax of digoxin by 26% (90% confidence interval: 16<U+2013>34%) and decreases mean trough concentrations of digoxin by 9% (90% confidence limit: 19% decrease to 2% increase).
0	The amount of metformin absorbed while taking PRECOSE was bioequivalent to the amount absorbed when taking placebo, as indicated by the plasma AUC values.
1	However, the peak plasma level of metformin was reduced by approximately 20% when taking PRECOSE due to a slight delay in the absorption of metformin.
0	There is little if any clinically significant interaction between PRECOSE and metformin.
0	OSMOLEX ER is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal disease (i.e., creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min/1.73 m2).
0	OSMOLEX ER is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal disease (4)
0	The initial dosage is 129 mg orally once daily in the morning (2.1) The dosage may be increased in weekly intervals to a maximum daily dose of 322 mg once daily in the morning (2.1) Swallow tablets whole; do not chew, crush, or divide (2.2) Dosing frequency reduction and monitoring required for renal impairment (2.3, 8.6) The recommended initial dosage of OSMOLEX ER is 129 mg administered orally once daily in the morning.
0	The dosage may be increased in weekly intervals to a maximum daily dose of 322 mg (administered as a 129 mg and 193 mg tablet), taken in the morning.
0	OSMOLEX ER is not interchangeable with other amantadine immediate- or extended-release products.
0	For patients unable to tolerate more than 100 mg per day of immediate-release amantadine, there is no equivalent dose or dosing regimen of OSMOLEX ER.
0	OSMOLEX ER can be administered without regard to food.
0	There are no modifications for the recommended initial and maximum dosage in patients with renal impairment; however, modifications are recommended for the titration interval and frequency of dosing in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment.
0	Table 1: Recommended Titration and Frequency of OSMOLEX ER Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Renal Function/Estimated GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)* Minimum Titration Interval Frequency of Dosing Regimen Mild renal impairment (60 to 89) Increase every week One dose every 24 hours Moderate renal impairment (30 to 59) Increase every 3 weeks One dose every 48 hours Severe renal impairment (15 to 29) Increase every 4 weeks One dose every 96 hours End-Stage Renal Disease (below 15) Contraindicated * estimated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) method Monitor patients with renal impairment for change in renal function, especially in those with severe renal impairment receiving the maximum daily dosage of 322 mg.
0	OSMOLEX ER should not be discontinued abruptly.
0	The dose should be reduced gradually from higher doses to 129 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks before discontinuing.
0	If a dose of OSMOLEX ER is missed, the next dose should be taken as scheduled.
0	Anticholinergic Drugs: Increased risk of anticholinergic effects; the dose of anticholinergic drugs or OSMOLEX ER may require reduction (7.1) Drugs Affecting Urinary pH: Excretion increases with acidic urine; possible accumulation with urine change towards alkaline (7.2) Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccines: Not recommended during use (7.3) Alcohol: Concomitant use is not recommended; increased potential for CNS effects (7.4) Products with anticholinergic properties may potentiate the anticholinergic-like side effects of amantadine.
0	The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of OSMOLEX ER should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently.
0	The pH of the urine has been reported to influence the excretion rate of amantadine.
0	Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate), and clinical state of the patient (e.g., renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract).
1	Since the excretion rate of amantadine increases rapidly when the urine is acidic, the administration of urine acidifying drugs may increase the elimination of the drug from the body.
0	Alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse reactions.
0	Monitor for efficacy or adverse reactions under conditions that alter the urine pH to more acidic or alkaline, respectively.
0	Because of its antiviral properties, amantadine may interfere with the efficacy of live attenuated influenza vaccines.
0	Therefore, live vaccines are not recommended during treatment with OSMOLEX ER.
0	Inactivated influenza vaccines may be used, as appropriate.
0	Concomitant use with alcohol is not recommended, as it may increase the potential for central nervous system effects such as somnolence, dizziness, confusion, lightheadedness, and orthostatic hypotension.
0	Falling Asleep During Activities of Daily Living and Somnolence: Advise patients prior to treatment; ordinarily discontinue if occurs (5.1) Suicidality and Depression: Monitor patients for depressed mood, depression, or suicidal ideation or behavior (5.2) Hallucinations/Psychotic Behavior: Patients with major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with OSMOLEX ER; observe patients for the occurrence of hallucinations throughout treatment, especially at initiation and after dose increases (5.3) Dizziness and Orthostatic Hypotension: Monitor patients for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, especially after starting OSMOLEX ER or increasing the dose (5.4) Withdrawal-Emergent Hyperpyrexia and Confusion: Avoid sudden discontinuation (5.5) Impulse Control/Compulsive Behaviors: Ask patients about increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges; consider dose reduction or discontinuation if occurs (5.6) Patients treated with amantadine have reported falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including the operation of motor vehicles, which sometimes has resulted in accidents.
0	Patients may not perceive warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, or they may report feeling alert immediately prior to the event.
0	Before initiating treatment with OSMOLEX ER, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase the risk for somnolence with OSMOLEX ER, such as concomitant sedating medications, alcohol, or the presence of a sleep disorder.
0	If a patient develops daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require full attention (e.g., driving a motor vehicle, conversations, eating), OSMOLEX ER should ordinarily be discontinued.
0	If a decision is made to continue OSMOLEX ER, advise patients not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities that might result in harm if they become somnolent.
0	There is insufficient information to establish that dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living or daytime somnolence.
0	Suicide, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation have been reported in patients with and without prior history of psychiatric illness while treated with amantadine.
0	Amantadine can exacerbate psychiatric symptoms in patients with a history of psychiatric disorders or substance abuse.
0	Monitor patients for depression, including suicidal ideation or behavior.
0	Prescribers should consider whether the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment with OSMOLEX ER in patients with a history of suicidality or depression.
0	Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with OSMOLEX ER because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis.
0	Treatment with amantadine or abrupt withdrawal can cause confusion, psychosis, personality changes, agitation, aggressive behavior, hallucinations, paranoia, other psychotic or paranoia reactions.
0	Monitor patients for hallucinations throughout treatment but especially after initiation and after the dose of OSMOLEX ER is increased or decreased.
0	Dizziness and orthostatic hypotension can occur with OSMOLEX ER.
0	Patients should be monitored for these adverse reactions, especially after starting OSMOLEX ER or increasing the dose.
0	Concomitant use of alcohol when using OSMOLEX ER is not recommended.
0	A symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability), with no other obvious etiology, has been reported in association with rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone.
0	Abrupt discontinuation of OSMOLEX ER may cause an increase in the symptoms of Parkinson<U+2019>s disease or cause delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression, or slurred speech.
0	It is recommended to avoid sudden discontinuation of OSMOLEX ER.
0	Patients can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, binge eating, and/or other intense urges, and the inability to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central dopaminergic tone, including OSMOLEX ER.
0	In some cases, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the medication was stopped.
0	Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal, it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending, or other urges while being treated with OSMOLEX ER.
0	Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a patient develops such urges while taking OSMOLEX ER.
0	The mechanism by which amantadine exerts efficacy in the treatment of Parkinson<U+2019>s disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions is unknown.
0	Amantadine is a weak uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor; however, it exhibits anticholinergic-like side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation in humans.
0	Amantadine may have direct and indirect effects on dopamine neurons; it exerts dopaminergic-like side effects such as hallucinations and dizziness in humans.
0	The effect of amantadine on QT prolongation was not studied in a dedicated thorough QT study.
0	Alcohol consumption may increase the potential for CNS effects, such as somnolence, dizziness, confusion, lightheadedness, and orthostatic hypotension.
0	OSMOLEX ER tablet consists of an immediate-release outer layer and an extended-release core.
0	The pharmacokinetics of amantadine from OSMOLEX ER is dose proportional across the dose range of 129 mg to 322 mg. Absorption Following oral administration of OSMOLEX ER, peak concentration of amantadine was observed in a median time of 7.5 hours (range 5.5 to 12 hours).
0	After a single oral administration of the 129 mg dose, the mean (CV%) Cmax and AUC were 328 ng/ml (18%) and 8263 ng.h/ml (18%) respectively.
0	Cmax and AUC with other dose levels of OSMOLEX ER increase proportionally.
0	Effect of Food Food does not affect the rate or the extent of absorption of OSMOLEX ER.
0	Distribution Amantadine is 67% bound to plasma proteins over a concentration range of 0.1 to 2.0 <U+03BC>g/mL.
0	The volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 3-8 L/kg, suggesting potential extravascular distribution.
0	Elimination Amantadine is mainly eliminated renally, and approximately 85% of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.
0	After oral administration of a single 129 mg OSMOLEX ER tablet, the apparent oral clearance was approximately11 L/h.
0	The half-life was approximately 16 hours.
0	Metabolism Metabolism accounts for only 5-15% of the total clearance for amantadine.
0	Eight metabolites of amantadine have been identified in human urine.
0	One metabolite, an N-acetylated compound, was quantified in human urine and accounted for 0-15% of the administered dose in multiple studies.
0	The contribution of this metabolite to efficacy or toxicity is not known.
0	Excretion Amantadine is primarily excreted by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.
0	Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Amantadine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.
0	Patients with Renal Impairment The renal clearance of amantadine is significantly lower in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function.
0	Therefore, a reduction in dosing frequency is required for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment.
0	Male and Female Patients In a study of young healthy subjects (n=20), mean renal clearance of amantadine, normalized for body mass index, was 1.5 fold higher in males compared to females.
0	No dose adjustment by gender is warranted.
1	Drug Interaction Studies Coadministration of quinine or quinidine with amantadine was shown to reduce the renal clearance of amantadine by about 30%.
0	The clinical significance of this effect is unknown.

0	The use of drugs which cause peripheral neuropathy (e.g., bortezomib, amiodarone, cisplatin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, vincristine, disulfiram, phenytoin, metronidazole, alcohol) can cause an additive effect and should be used with caution.
0	Hormonal contraceptives increase the risk of thromboembolism.
0	In 10 healthy women, the pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of a single dose containing 1.0 mg of norethindrone acetate and 75 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were studied.
0	The results were similar with and without coadministration of thalidomide 200 mg/day to steady-state levels.
0	In 13 healthy men, the pharmacokinetic profile and international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time for warfarin, following a single oral dose of 25 mg, were similar with and without the coadministration of thalidomide 200 mg/day at steady-state levels.
0	The single dose of warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of thalidomide.
0	Concomitant use of HIV-protease inhibitors, griseofulvin, modafinil, penicillins, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or certain herbal supplements such as St. John's Wort with hormonal contraceptive agents may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception up to one month after discontinuation of these concomitant therapies.
0	Therefore, females requiring treatment with one or more of these drugs must use two OTHER effective or highly effective methods of contraception while taking thalidomide.
0	Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thromboembolism, such as estrogen containing therapies, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving thalidomide with dexamethasone.

0	Hypersensitivity: Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity to the drug and its components.
0	Thalidomide is a powerful human teratogen that induces a high frequency of severe and life-threatening birth defects, even after a single dose.
0	When there is no satisfactory alternative treatment, females of reproductive potential may be treated with thalidomide provided adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy.
0	THALOMID<U+00AE> (thalidomide) is only available through the THALOMID REMS program.
0	Oral ingestion is the only type of maternal thalidomide exposure known to result in drug-associated birth defects.
0	There are no specific data available regarding the reproductive risks of cutaneous absorption or inhalation of thalidomide; however, females of reproductive potential should avoid contact with THALOMID<U+00AE> (thalidomide) Capsules.
0	THALOMID Capsules should be stored in blister packs until ingestion.
0	If there is contact with non-intact thalidomide capsules or the powder contents, the exposed area should be washed with soap and water.

0	Appropriate precautions should be utilized, such as wearing gloves to prevent the potential cutaneous exposure to THALOMID.
0	Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning THALOMID therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy.
0	Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control, beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with THALOMID, during therapy, during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of THALOMID therapy.
0	Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy.
0	The first test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing THALOMID therapy and then weekly during the first month, then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles.
0	Males Thalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug.
0	Therefore, males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking THALOMID and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing THALOMID, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy.
0	Male patients taking THALOMID must not donate sperm.
0	Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with THALOMID and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to THALOMID.
0	Because of the embryo-fetal risk, THALOMID is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), the THALOMID REMS program.
0	Required components of the THALOMID REMS program include the following: Prescribers must be certified with the THALOMID REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements.
0	Patients must sign a Patient-Physician Agreement Form and comply with the REMS requirements.
0	In particular, female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements and males must comply with contraception requirements.
0	Pharmacies must be certified with the THALOMID REMS program, must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive THALOMID and comply with REMS requirements.
0	Further information about the THALOMID REMS program is available at www.celgeneriskmanagement.com or by telephone at 1-888-423-5436.
0	The use of THALOMID in patients with MM results in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
0	Ischemic heart disease (11.1%), including myocardial infarction (1.3%), and stroke (cerebrovascular accident, 2.6%) have also occurred in patients with previously untreated MM treated with THALOMID and dexamethasone compared to placebo and dexamethasone (4.7%, 1.7%, and 0.9%, respectively) in one clinical trial.
0	Patients and physicians should be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism.
0	Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling.
0	Agents that also may increase the risk of thromboembolism should be used with caution in patients receiving THALOMID.
0	In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM, the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality.
0	Treatment of patients with MM with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials.
0	Thalidomide frequently causes drowsiness and somnolence.
0	Patients should be instructed to avoid situations where drowsiness may be a problem and not to take other medications that may cause drowsiness without adequate medical advice.
0	Advise patients as to the possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating other complex or dangerous machinery.
0	Thalidomide is known to cause nerve damage that may be permanent.
0	Peripheral neuropathy is a common (<U+2265>10%) and potentially severe adverse reaction of treatment with thalidomide that may be irreversible.
0	Peripheral neuropathy generally occurs following chronic use over a period of months; however, peripheral neuropathy following relatively short-term use has been reported.
0	The correlation with cumulative dose is unclear.
0	Symptoms may occur some time after thalidomide treatment has been stopped and may resolve slowly or not at all.
0	Few reports of neuropathy have arisen in the treatment of ENL despite long-term thalidomide treatment.
0	However, the inability clinically to differentiate thalidomide neuropathy from the neuropathy often seen in Hansen's disease makes it difficult to determine accurately the incidence of thalidomide-related neuropathy in ENL patients treated with thalidomide.
0	Patients should be examined at monthly intervals for the first 3 months of thalidomide therapy to enable the clinician to detect early signs of neuropathy, which include numbness, tingling or pain in the hands and feet.
0	Patients should be evaluated periodically thereafter during treatment.
0	Patients should be regularly counseled, questioned, and evaluated for signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.
0	Consideration should be given to electrophysiological testing, consisting of measurement of sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes at baseline and thereafter every 6 months in an effort to detect asymptomatic neuropathy.
0	If symptoms of drug-induced neuropathy develop, thalidomide should be discontinued immediately to limit further damage, if clinically appropriate.
0	Usually, treatment with thalidomide should only be reinitiated if the neuropathy returns to baseline status.
0	Medications known to be associated with neuropathy should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide.
0	Patients should also be advised that thalidomide may cause dizziness and orthostatic hypotension and that, therefore, they should sit upright for a few minutes prior to standing up from a recumbent position.
0	Decreased white blood cell counts, including neutropenia, have been reported in association with the clinical use of thalidomide.
0	Treatment should not be initiated with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of <750/mm3.
0	White blood cell count and differential should be monitored on an ongoing basis, especially in patients who may be more prone to neutropenia, such as patients who are HIV-seropositive.
0	If ANC decreases to below 750/mm3 while on treatment, the patient's medication regimen should be re-evaluated and, if the neutropenia persists, consideration should be given to withholding thalidomide if clinically appropriate.
0	Thrombocytopenia, including Grade 3 or 4 occurrences, has been reported in association with the clinical use of thalidomide.
0	Monitor blood counts, including platelet counts.
0	Dose reduction, delay, or discontinuation may be required.
0	Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding including petechiae, epistaxis, and gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if concomitant medication may increase the risk of bleeding.
0	In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of thalidomide in an HIV-seropositive patient population, plasma HIV RNA levels were found to increase (median change = 0.42 log10 copies HIV RNA/mL, p = 0.04 compared to placebo).
0	A similar trend was observed in a second, unpublished study conducted in patients who were HIV-seropositive.
0	The clinical significance of this increase is unknown.
0	Both studies were conducted prior to availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy.
0	Until the clinical significance of this finding is further understood, in HIV-seropositive patients, viral load should be measured after the first and third months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter.
0	Bradycardia in association with thalidomide use has been reported.
0	Cases of bradycardia have been reported, some required medical interventions.
0	The clinical significance and underlying etiology of the bradycardia noted in some thalidomide-treated patients are presently unknown.
0	Monitor patients for bradycardia and syncope.
0	Medications known to decrease heart rate should be used with caution in patients receiving thalidomide.
0	Serious dermatologic reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which may be fatal, have been reported.
0	THALOMID should be discontinued if a skin rash occurs and only resumed following appropriate clinical evaluation.
0	If the rash is exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous or if Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis is suspected, use of THALOMID should not be resumed.
0	Although not reported from pre-marketing controlled clinical trials, seizures, including grand mal convulsions, have been reported during post-approval use of THALOMID in clinical practice.
0	Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made.
0	Most patients had disorders that may have predisposed them to seizure activity, and it is not currently known whether thalidomide has any epileptogenic influence.
0	During therapy with thalidomide, patients with a history of seizures or with other risk factors for the development of seizures should be monitored closely for clinical changes that could precipitate acute seizure activity.
0	Monitor patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g., patients with high tumor burden prior to treatment) and take appropriate precautions.
0	Some contraceptive methods may pose a higher risk of adverse effects or may be medically contraindicated in some patients treated with THALOMID.
0	Because some patients may develop sudden, severe neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, use of an intrauterine device (IUD) or implantable contraception in these patients may carry an increased risk for infection or bleeding either at insertion, removal or during use.
0	Treatment with THALOMID, the presence of an underlying malignancy, and/or use of an estrogen-containing contraceptive can each increase the risk of thromboembolism.
0	It is not known if these risks of thromboembolism are additive.
0	However, they should be taken into consideration when choosing contraceptive methods.
0	Hypersensitivity to THALOMID has been reported.
0	Signs and symptoms have included the occurrence of erythematous macular rash, possibly associated with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, and if severe, may necessitate interruption of therapy.
0	If the reaction recurs when dosing is resumed, THALOMID should be discontinued.
0	The mechanism of action of THALOMID is not fully understood.
0	Cellular activities of thalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex.
0	THALOMID possesses immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties.
0	Available data from in vitro studies and clinical trials suggest that the immunologic effects of this compound can vary substantially under different conditions, but may be related to suppression of excessive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-<U+03B1>) production and down-modulation of selected cell surface adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte migration.
0	For example, administration of thalidomide has been reported to decrease circulating levels of TNF-<U+03B1> in patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL); however, it has also been shown to increase plasma TNF-<U+03B1> levels in HIV-seropositive patients.
0	Other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of thalidomide may include suppression of macrophage involvement in prostaglandin synthesis, and modulation of interleukin-10 and interleukin-12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
0	Thalidomide treatment of multiple myeloma patients is accompanied by an increase in the number of circulating natural killer cells, and an increase in plasma levels of interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma (T cell-derived cytokines associated with cytotoxic activity).
0	Thalidomide was found to inhibit angiogenesis in a human umbilical artery explant model in vitro.
0	The cellular processes of angiogenesis inhibited by thalidomide may include the proliferation of endothelial cells.
0	Absorption Absorption of THALOMID is slow after oral administration.
0	The maximum plasma concentrations are reached approximately 2-5 hours after administration.
0	The absolute bioavailability of thalidomide from thalidomide capsules has not yet been characterized in human subjects due to its poor aqueous solubility.
0	Based on the 14C-radiolabel thalidomide study in human, greater than 90% of the total radioactivity is recovered in urine suggesting good oral absorption.
0	While the extent of absorption (as measured by area under the curve [AUC]) is proportional to dose in healthy subjects, the observed peak concentration (Cmax) increased in a less than proportional manner.
0	This lack of Cmax dose proportionality, coupled with the observed increase in Tmax values, suggests that the poor solubility of thalidomide in aqueous media may be hindering the rate of absorption.

0	At therapeutic concentrations, thalidomide is not an inhibitor or inducer of human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro.
0	Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 are not anticipated.
0	Elimination The mean elimination half-life of thalidomide in plasma following single oral doses between 50 mg and 400 mg was 5.5 to 7.3 hours.
0	Following a single 400 mg oral dose of radiolabeled thalidomide, the total mean recovery was 93.6% of the administered dose by Day 8.
0	The majority of the radioactive dose was excreted within 48 hours following dose administration.
0	In humans, 14C-thalidomide is primarily excreted in urine (91.9% of the radioactive dose) mainly as hydrolytic metabolites while fecal excretion is minor (<2% of the dose).
0	Unchanged thalidomide is not eliminated by the kidney to a notable degree (<3.5% of the dose).
0	Effects of Weight There is a linear relationship between body weight and estimated thalidomide clearance.
0	In MM patients with body weight from 47-133 kg, thalidomide clearance ranged from approximately 6-12 L/h, representing an increase in thalidomide clearance of 0.605 L/h per 10 kg body weight increase.
0	Effects of Age, Gender and Race Analysis of the data from pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers and patients with Hansen's disease ranging in age from 20 to 69 years does not reveal any age-related changes.
0	While a comparative trial of the effects of gender on thalidomide pharmacokinetics has not been conducted, examination of the data for thalidomide does not reveal any significant gender differences in pharmacokinetic parameter values.
0	Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.
0	Pharmacokinetic Data in Special Populations HIV-seropositive Subjects: There is no apparent significant difference in measured pharmacokinetic parameter values between healthy human subjects and HIV-seropositive subjects following single-dose administration of THALOMID Capsules.
0	Patients with Hansen's Disease: Analysis of data from a small study in Hansen's patients suggests that these patients, relative to healthy subjects, may have an increased bioavailability of THALOMID.
0	The increase is reflected both in an increased area under the curve and in increased peak plasma levels.
0	Pediatric: No pharmacokinetic data are available in subjects below the age of 18 years.
0	LIALDA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to salicylates or aminosalicylates or to any of the ingredients of LIALDA.
0	Patients with known hypersensitivity to salicylates or aminosalicylates or to any of the ingredients of LIALDA tablets.
0	The recommended dosage for the induction of remission in adult patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis is two to four 1.2 g tablets taken once daily with a meal for a total daily dose of 2.4 g or 4.8 g. The recommended dosage for the maintenance of remission is two 1.2 g tablets taken once daily with a meal for a total daily dose of 2.4 g. For induction of remission of active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, two to four 1.2 g tablets taken once daily with food.
0	For maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis, two 1.2 g tablets taken once daily with food.
0	No investigations of interaction between LIALDA and other drugs except for certain antibiotics have been performed.
0	However, the following drug-drug interactions have been reported for products containing mesalamine: Nephrotoxic agents including NSAIDs: renal reactions have been reported.
0	Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine: blood disorders have been reported.
0	The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of renal reactions.
0	The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may increase the risk for blood disorders.

0	Use caution when treating patients with liver disease.
0	Upper GI tract obstruction may delay onset of action.
0	Patients with pre-existing skin conditions have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions (5.6) Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.
0	Renal impairment, including minimal change nephropathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, and, rarely, renal failure, has been reported in patients given products such as LIALDA that contain mesalamine or are converted to mesalamine.
0	It is recommended that patients have an evaluation of renal function prior to initiation of LIALDA therapy and periodically while on therapy.
0	Exercise caution when using LIALDA in patients with known renal dysfunction or a history of renal disease.
0	In animal studies, the kidney was the principal organ for toxicity.
0	Mesalamine has been associated with an acute intolerance syndrome that may be difficult to distinguish from an exacerbation of ulcerative colitis.
0	Although the exact frequency of occurrence has not been determined, it has occurred in 3% of patients in controlled clinical trials of mesalamine or sulfasalazine.
0	Symptoms include cramping, acute abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and sometimes fever, headache, and rash.
0	If acute intolerance syndrome is suspected, promptly discontinue treatment with LIALDA.
0	Some patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfasalazine may have a similar reaction to LIALDA tablets or to other compounds that contain or are converted to mesalamine.
0	Mesalamine-induced cardiac hypersensitivity reactions (myocarditis and pericarditis) have been reported with LIALDA and other mesalamine medications.
0	Caution should be taken in prescribing this medicine to patients with conditions predisposing them to the development of myocarditis or pericarditis.
0	There have been reports of hepatic failure in patients with pre-existing liver disease who have been administered mesalamine.
0	Caution should be exercised when administering LIALDA to patients with liver disease.
0	Pyloric stenosis or other organic or functional obstruction in the upper gastrointestinal tract may cause prolonged gastric retention of LIALDA which would delay mesalamine release in the colon.
0	Patients with pre-existing skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and atopic eczema have reported more severe photosensitivity reactions.
0	Use of mesalamine may lead to spuriously elevated test results when measuring urinary normetanephrine by liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection because of the similarity in the chromatograms of normetanephrine and mesalamine's main metabolite, N-acetylaminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA).
0	An alternative, selective assay for normetanephrine should be considered.
0	The mechanism of action of mesalamine is not fully understood, but appears to have a topical anti-inflammatory effect on the colonic epithelial cells.
0	Mucosal production of arachidonic acid metabolites, both through the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, is increased in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and it is possible that mesalamine diminishes inflammation by blocking cyclooxygenase and inhibiting prostaglandin production in the colon.
0	Mesalamine has the potential to inhibit the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF<U+03BA>B) and consequently the production of key pro-inflammatory cytokines.
0	It has been proposed that reduced expression of PPAR<U+03B3> nuclear receptors (<U+03B3>-form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) may be implicated in ulcerative colitis.
0	There is evidence that mesalamine produces pharmacodynamic effects through direct activation of PPAR<U+03B3> receptors in the colonic/rectal epithelium.
0	The pharmacodynamic actions of mesalamine occur in the colonic/rectal mucosae local to the delivery of drug from LIALDA into the lumen.
0	There is information suggesting that severity of colonic inflammation in ulcerative colitis patients treated with mesalamine is inversely correlated with mucosal concentrations of mesalamine.
0	Plasma concentrations representing systemically absorbed mesalamine are not believed to contribute extensively to efficacy.
0	Absorption The total absorption of mesalamine from LIALDA 2.4 g or 4.8 g given once daily for 14 days to healthy volunteers was found to be approximately 21-22% of the administered dose.
0	Gamma-scintigraphy studies have shown that a single dose of LIALDA 1.2 g (one tablet) passed intact through the upper gastrointestinal tract of fasted healthy volunteers.
0	Scintigraphic images showed a trail of radio-labeled tracer in the colon, suggesting that mesalamine had distributed through this region of the gastrointestinal tract.
0	In a single dose study, LIALDA 1.2 g, 2.4 g and 4.8 g were administered in the fasted state to healthy subjects.
0	Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 2 hours and reached a maximum by 9-12 hours on average for the doses studied.
0	The pharmacokinetic parameters are highly variable among subjects (Table 3).
0	Mesalamine systemic exposure in terms of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was slightly more than dose proportional between 1.2 g and 4.8 g LIALDA.
0	Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of mesalamine increased approximately dose proportionately between 1.2 g and 2.4 g and sub-proportionately between 2.4 g and 4.8 g LIALDA, with the dose normalized value at 4.8 g representing, on average, 74% of that at 2.4 g based on geometric means.

1	However, a high fat meal increased systemic exposure of mesalamine (mean Cmax:<U+2191> 91%; mean AUC: <U+2191> 16%) compared to results in the fasted state.
0	LIALDA was administered with food in the controlled clinical trials that supported its approval.
0	In a single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic study of LIALDA, 2.4 g or 4.8 g was administered once daily with standard meals to 28 healthy volunteers per dose group.
0	Plasma concentrations of mesalamine were detectable after 4 hours and were maximal by 8 hours after the single dose.
0	Steady state was achieved generally by 2 days after dosing.
0	Mean AUC at steady state was only modestly greater (1.1- to 1.4-fold) than predictable from single dose pharmacokinetics.
0	In a single dose pharmacokinetic study of LIALDA, 4.8 g was administered in the fasted state to 71 healthy male and female volunteers (28 young (18-35yrs); 28 elderly (65-75yrs); 15 elderly (>75yrs)).
0	Increased age resulted in increased systemic exposure (approximately 2-fold in Cmax), to mesalamine and its metabolite N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid.

0	ARAVA is not recommended for patients with severe immunodeficiency, bone marrow dysplasia, or severe, uncontrolled infections.
0	If a serious infection occurs, consider interrupting ARAVA therapy and initiating the accelerated drug elimination procedure.
0	Medications like ARAVA that have immunosuppression potential may cause patients to be more susceptible to infections, including opportunistic infections, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, tuberculosis (including extra-pulmonary tuberculosis), and aspergillosis.
0	Severe infections including sepsis, which may be fatal, have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA, especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and aspergillosis.
0	Most of the reports were confounded by concomitant immunosuppressant therapy and/or comorbid illness which, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, may predispose patients to infection.
0	Cases of tuberculosis were observed in clinical studies with teriflunomide, the metabolite of ARAVA.
0	Prior to initiating ARAVA, all patients should be screened for active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection as per commonly used diagnostic tests.
0	ARAVA has not been studied in patients with a positive tuberculosis screen, and the safety of ARAVA in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown.
0	Patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening should be treated by standard medical practice prior to therapy with ARAVA and monitored carefully during ARAVA treatment for possible reactivation of the infection.
0	Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA alone.
0	These events have been reported most frequently in patients who received concomitant treatment with methotrexate or other immunosuppressive agents, or who had recently discontinued these therapies; in some cases, patients had a prior history of a significant hematologic abnormality.

0	If used with concomitant methotrexate and/or other potential immunosuppressive agents, chronic monitoring should be monthly.
0	If evidence of bone marrow suppression occurs in a patient taking ARAVA, stop treatment with ARAVA, and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure to reduce the plasma concentration of the ARAVA active metabolite, teriflunomide.
0	In any situation in which the decision is made to switch from ARAVA to another anti-rheumatic agent with a known potential for hematologic suppression, it would be prudent to monitor for hematologic toxicity, because there will be overlap of systemic exposure to both compounds.
0	Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving ARAVA.
0	If a patient taking ARAVA develops any of these conditions, stop ARAVA treatment and perform an accelerated drug elimination procedure.

0	Interstitial lung disease is a potentially fatal disorder that may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has a variable clinical presentation.
0	New onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnea, with or without associated fever, may be a reason for discontinuation of ARAVA therapy and for further investigation as appropriate.
0	If discontinuation of ARAVA is necessary, consider performing an accelerated drug elimination procedure.
0	No clinical data are available on the efficacy and safety of vaccinations during ARAVA treatment.
0	Vaccination with live vaccines is, however, not recommended.

0	Several in vivo and in vitro experimental models have demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect.
0	Plasma concentrations of the parent drug, leflunomide, have been occasionally seen at very low concentrations.
0	Studies of the pharmacokinetics of leflunomide have primarily examined the plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, teriflunomide.
0	Absorption Following oral administration, peak teriflunomide concentrations occurred between 6 <U+2013>12 hours after dosing.
0	Due to the very long half-life of teriflunomide (18<U+2013>19 days), a loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days was used in clinical studies to facilitate the rapid attainment of steady-state teriflunomide concentrations.
0	Without a loading dose, it is estimated that attainment of steady-state plasma concentrations would require about two months of dosing.
0	The resulting plasma concentrations following both loading doses and continued clinical dosing indicate that plasma teriflunomide concentrations are dose proportional.
0	Effect of Food Co-administration of leflunomide tablets with a high fat meal did not have a significant impact on teriflunomide plasma concentrations.
0	Distribution Teriflunomide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>99%) and is mainly distributed in plasma.

0	Without use of an accelerated drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma teriflunomide concentrations of less than 0.02 mg/L, due to individual variation in drug clearance.
0	After a single IV administration of the metabolite (teriflunomide), the total body clearance of teriflunomide was 30.5 mL/h.
0	Metabolism In vitro inhibition studies in human liver microsomes suggest that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C19 and 3A4 are involved in leflunomide metabolism.
0	In vivo, leflunomide is metabolized to one primary (teriflunomide) and many minor metabolites.

0	Over 21 days, 60.1% of the administered dose is excreted via feces (37.5%) and urine (22.6%).
1	After an accelerated elimination procedure with cholestyramine, an additional 23.1% was recovered (mostly in feces).
0	Studies with both hemodialysis and CAPD (chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) indicate that teriflunomide is not dialyzable.
0	Specific Populations Gender.
0	Gender has not been shown to cause a consistent change in the in vivo pharmacokinetics of teriflunomide.
0	A population based pharmacokinetic analysis of the clinical trial data indicates that smokers have a 38% increase in clearance over non-smokers; however, no difference in clinical efficacy was seen between smokers and nonsmokers.

0	Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP), an obligate chain terminator.
0	Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and HBV RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination.
0	Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases <U+03B1>, <U+03B2>, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase <U+03B3>.
0	Activity against HIV Antiviral Activity The antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes.
0	The EC50 (50% effective concentration) values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04 <U+00B5>M to 8.5 <U+00B5>M.
0	In drug combination studies, tenofovir was not antagonistic with HIV-1 NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zidovudine), NNRTIs (efavirenz, nevirapine), and protease inhibitors (amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).
0	Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged from 0.5 <U+00B5>M to 2.2 <U+00B5>M) and strain-specific activity against HIV-2 (EC50 values ranged from 1.6 <U+00B5>M to 5.5 <U+00B5>M).
0	Resistance HIV-1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture.
0	These viruses expressed a K65R substitution in RT and showed a 2- to 4-fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir.
0	In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 RT has been selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir.
0	In Trial 903 of treatment-na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve subjects (VIREAD+3TC+EFV versus d4T+3TC+EFV), genotypic analyses of isolates from subjects with virologic failure through Week 144 showed development of EFV and 3TC resistance-associated substitutions to occur most frequently and with no difference between the treatment arms.
0	The K65R substitution occurred in 8/47 (17%) of analyzed patient isolates in the VIREAD arm and in 2/49 (4%) of analyzed patient isolates in the d4T arm.
0	Of the 8 subjects whose virus developed K65R in the VIREAD arm through 144 weeks, 7 occurred in the first 48 weeks of treatment and one at Week 96.
0	One patient in the VIREAD arm developed the K70E substitution in the virus.
0	Other substitutions resulting in resistance to VIREAD were not identified in this trial.
0	In Trial 934 of treatment-na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve subjects (VIREAD+FTC+EFV versus AZT/3TC+EFV), genotypic analysis performed on HIV-1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with >400 copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation showed development of EFV resistance-associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the two treatment arms.
0	The M184V substitution, associated with resistance to FTC and 3TC, was observed in 2/19 of analyzed subject isolates in the VIREAD+FTC group and in 10/29 of analyzed subject isolates in the AZT/3TC group.
0	Through 144 weeks of Trial 934, no subjects have developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV-1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis.
0	Cross Resistance Cross resistance among certain HIV-1 NRTIs has been recognized.
0	The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV-1 infected subjects treated with abacavir or didanosine.
0	HIV-1 isolates with this substitution also show reduced susceptibility to FTC and 3TC.
0	Therefore, cross resistance among these drugs may occur in patients whose virus harbors the K65R or K70E substitution.
0	HIV-1 isolates from subjects (N=20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of three AZT-associated RT substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N), showed a 3.1-fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir.
0	In Trials 902 and 907 conducted in treatment-experienced subjects (VIREAD + Standard Background Therapy (SBT) compared to placebo + SBT), 14/304 (5%) of the VIREAD-treated subjects with virologic failure through Week 96 had >1.4-fold (median 2.7-fold) reduced susceptibility to tenofovir.
0	Genotypic analysis of the baseline and failure isolates showed the development of the K65R substitution in the HIV-1 RT gene.
0	The virologic response to VIREAD therapy has been evaluated with respect to baseline viral genotype (N=222) in treatment-experienced subjects participating in Trials 902 and 907.
0	In these clinical trials, 94% of the participants evaluated had baseline HIV-1 isolates expressing at least one NRTI substitution.
0	Virologic responses for subjects in the genotype substudy were similar to the overall trial results.
0	Several exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate the effect of specific substitutions and substitutional patterns on virologic outcome.
0	Because of the large number of potential comparisons, statistical testing was not conducted.
0	Varying degrees of cross resistance of VIREAD to pre-existing AZT resistance-associated substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) were observed and appeared to depend on the type and number of specific substitutions.
0	VIREAD-treated subjects whose HIV-1 expressed 3 or more AZT resistance-associated substitutions that included either the M41L or L210W RT substitution showed reduced responses to VIREAD therapy; however, these responses were still improved compared with placebo.
0	The presence of the D67N, K70R, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N substitution did not appear to affect responses to VIREAD therapy.
0	Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without AZT resistance-associated substitutions (N=8) had reduced response to VIREAD.
0	Limited data are available for subjects whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution (N=3), Q151M substitution (N=2), or T69 insertion (N=4), all of whom had a reduced response.
0	In the protocol defined analyses, virologic response to VIREAD was not reduced in subjects with HIV-1 that expressed the abacavir/FTC/3TC resistance-associated M184V substitution.
0	HIV-1 RNA responses among these subjects were durable through Week 48.
0	Trials 902 and 907 Phenotypic Analyses Phenotypic analysis of baseline HIV-1 from treatment-experienced subjects (N=100) demonstrated a correlation between baseline susceptibility to VIREAD and response to VIREAD therapy.

0	Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease.
0	Significantly elevated serum calcitonin may indicate MTC, and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L.
0	If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated.
0	Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.
0	Based on spontaneous post-marketing reports, acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with liraglutide.
0	After initiation of Saxenda, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting).
0	If pancreatitis is suspected, Saxenda should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.
0	If pancreatitis is confirmed, Saxenda should not be restarted.
0	In Saxenda clinical trials, acute pancreatitis was confirmed by adjudication in 9 (0.3%) of 3291 Saxenda-treated patients and 2 (0.1%) of 1843 placebo-treated patients.
0	In addition, there were 2 cases of acute pancreatitis in Saxenda-treated patients who prematurely withdrew from these clinical trials, occurring 74 and 124 days after the last dose.
0	There were 2 additional cases in Saxenda-treated patients, 1 during an off-treatment follow-up period within 2 weeks of discontinuing Saxenda, and 1 that occurred in a patient who completed treatment and was off-treatment for 106 days.
0	Liraglutide has been studied in a limited number of patients with a history of pancreatitis.
0	It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on Saxenda.
0	In Saxenda clinical trials, 2.2% of Saxenda-treated patients reported adverse events of cholelithiasis versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients.
0	The incidence of cholecystitis was 0.8% in Saxenda-treated patients versus 0.4% in placebo-treated patients.
0	The majority of Saxenda-treated patients with adverse events of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis required cholecystectomy.
0	Substantial or rapid weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis; however, the incidence of acute gallbladder disease was greater in Saxenda-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients even after accounting for the degree of weight loss.
0	If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.
0	The risk for serious hypoglycemia is increased when Saxenda is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (for example, sulfonylureas) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
0	Therefore, patients may require a lower dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues) in this setting.
0	Saxenda should not be used in patients taking insulin.
0	Saxenda can lower blood glucose.
0	Monitor blood glucose parameters prior to starting Saxenda and during Saxenda treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.
0	If needed, adjust co-administered anti-diabetic drugs based on glucose monitoring results and risk of hypoglycemia.
0	Mean increases in resting heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute (bpm) were observed with routine clinical monitoring in Saxenda-treated patients compared to placebo in clinical trials.
0	More patients treated with Saxenda, compared with placebo, had changes from baseline at two consecutive visits of more than 10 bpm (34% versus 19%, respectively) and 20 bpm (5% versus 2%, respectively).
0	At least one resting heart rate exceeding 100 bpm was recorded for 6% of Saxenda-treated patients compared with 4% of placebo-treated patients, with this occurring at two consecutive study visits for 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively.
0	Tachycardia was reported as an adverse reaction in 0.6% of Saxenda-treated patients and in 0.1% of placebo-treated patients.
0	In a clinical pharmacology trial that monitored heart rate continuously for 24 hours, Saxenda treatment was associated with a heart rate that was 4 to 9 bpm higher than that observed with placebo.
0	Heart rate should be monitored at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice.
0	Patients should inform health care providers of palpitations or feelings of a racing heartbeat while at rest during Saxenda treatment.
0	For patients who experience a sustained increase in resting heart rate while taking Saxenda, Saxenda should be discontinued.
0	In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Saxenda, there have been reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, sometimes requiring hemodialysis.
0	Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease.
0	A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea leading to volume depletion.
0	Some of the reported events occurred in patients receiving one or more medications known to affect renal function or volume status.
0	Altered renal function has been reversed in many of the reported cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents, including liraglutide.
0	Use caution when initiating or escalating doses of Saxenda in patients with renal impairment.
0	There have been reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in patients treated with liraglutide.
0	If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patient should discontinue Saxenda and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice.
0	Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists.
0	Use caution in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with Saxenda.
0	In Saxenda clinical trials, 9 (0.3%) of 3384 Saxenda-treated patients and 2 (0.1%) of the 1941 placebo-treated patients reported suicidal ideation; one of these Saxenda-treated patients attempted suicide.
0	Patients treated with Saxenda should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.
0	Discontinue Saxenda in patients who experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors.
0	Avoid Saxenda in patients with a history of suicidal attempts or active suicidal ideation.
0	Liraglutide is an acylated human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with 97% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1(7-37).
0	Like endogenous GLP-1, liraglutide binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, a cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase activation through the stimulatory G-protein, Gs.
0	Endogenous GLP-1 has a half-life of 1.5-2 minutes due to degradation by the ubiquitous endogenous enzymes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and neutral endopeptidases (NEP).
0	Unlike native GLP-1, liraglutide is stable against metabolic degradation by both peptidases and has a plasma half-life of 13 hours after subcutaneous administration.
0	The pharmacokinetic profile of liraglutide, which makes it suitable for once-daily administration, is a result of self-association that delays absorption, plasma protein binding, and stability against metabolic degradation by DPP-4 and NEP.
0	GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and calorie intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation.
0	In animal studies, peripheral administration of liraglutide resulted in the presence of liraglutide in specific brain regions regulating appetite, including the hypothalamus.
0	Although liraglutide activated neurons in brain regions known to regulate appetite, specific brain regions mediating the effects of liraglutide on appetite were not identified in rats.
0	Liraglutide lowers body weight through decreased calorie intake.
0	Liraglutide does not increase 24-hour energy expenditure.
0	As with other GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner.
0	These effects can lead to a reduction of blood glucose.
0	Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc) in healthy volunteers The effect of liraglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a QTc study.
0	Liraglutide at steady-state concentrations after daily doses up to 1.8 mg did not produce QTc prolongation.
0	The maximum liraglutide plasma concentration (Cmax) in overweight and obese subjects treated with liraglutide 3 mg is similar to the Cmax observed in the liraglutide QTc study in healthy volunteers.
0	Absorption - Following subcutaneous administration, maximum concentrations of liraglutide are achieved at 11 hours post dosing.
0	The average liraglutide steady state concentration (AUC<U+03C4>/24) reached approximately 116 ng/mL in obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) subjects following administration of Saxenda.
0	Liraglutide exposure increased proportionally in the dose range of 0.6 mg to 3 mg.
0	The intra-subject coefficient of variation for liraglutide AUC was 11% following single dose administration.
0	Liraglutide exposures were considered similar among three subcutaneous injection sites (upper arm, abdomen, and thigh).
0	Absolute bioavailability of liraglutide following subcutaneous administration is approximately 55%.
0	Distribution - The mean apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of liraglutide 3 mg is 20-25 L (for a person weighing approximately 100 kg).
0	The mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of liraglutide is 0.07 L/kg.
0	Liraglutide is extensively bound to plasma protein (greater than 98%).
0	Metabolism - During the initial 24 hours following administration of a single [3H]-liraglutide dose to healthy subjects, the major component in plasma was intact liraglutide.
0	Liraglutide is endogenously metabolized in a similar manner to large proteins without a specific organ as a major route of elimination.
0	Elimination - Following a [3H]-liraglutide dose, intact liraglutide was not detected in urine or feces.
0	Only a minor part of the administered radioactivity was excreted as liraglutide-related metabolites in urine or feces (6% and 5%, respectively).
0	The majority of urine and feces radioactivity was excreted during the first 6-8 days.
0	The mean apparent clearance following subcutaneous administration of a single dose of liraglutide is approximately 0.9-1.4 L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 13 hours, making liraglutide suitable for once daily administration.
0	Specific Populations Elderly - No dosage adjustment is required based on age.
0	Age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on a pharmacokinetic study in healthy elderly subjects (65 to 83 years) and population pharmacokinetic analyses of data from overweight and obese patients 18 to 82 years of age.
0	Gender - Based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses, females have 24% lower weight adjusted clearance of Saxenda compared to males.
0	Based on the exposure response data, no dose adjustment is necessary based on gender.
0	Race and Ethnicity - Race and ethnicity had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on the results of population pharmacokinetic analyses that included overweight and obese patients of Caucasian, Black, Asian and Hispanic/Non-Hispanic groups.
0	Body Weight - Body weight significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of liraglutide based on results of population pharmacokinetic analyses conducted in patients with body weight range of 60-234 kg.
0	The exposure of liraglutide decreases as baseline body weight increases.
0	Pediatric - Saxenda has not been studied in pediatric patients.
0	Renal Impairment - The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment.
0	Subjects with mild (estimated creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) to severe (estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment and subjects with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis were included in the trial.
0	Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and in end-stage renal disease was on average 35%, 19%, 29% and 30% lower, respectively.
0	Hepatic Impairment - The single-dose pharmacokinetics of liraglutide were evaluated in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment.
0	Subjects with mild (Child Pugh score 5-6) to severe (Child Pugh score greater than 9) hepatic impairment were included in the trial.
0	Compared to healthy subjects, liraglutide AUC in subjects with mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment was on average 11%, 14% and 42% lower, respectively.
0	Drug Interactions In vitro assessment of drug<U+2212>drug interactions Liraglutide has low potential for pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions related to cytochrome P450 (CYP) and plasma protein binding.
0	In vivo assessment of drug<U+2212>drug interactions The drug-drug interaction studies were performed at steady state with liraglutide 1.8 mg/day.
0	The effect on rate of gastric emptying was equivalent between liraglutide 1.8 mg and 3 mg (acetaminophen AUC0-300min).
0	Administration of the interacting drugs was timed so that Cmax of liraglutide (8-12 h) would coincide with the absorption peak of the co-administered drugs.
0	Oral Contraceptives A single dose of an oral contraceptive combination product containing 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel was administered under fed conditions and 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state.
1	Liraglutide lowered ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel Cmax by 12% and 13%, respectively.
0	There was no effect of liraglutide on the overall exposure (AUC) of ethinylestradiol.
1	Liraglutide increased the levonorgestrel AUC0-<U+221E> by 18%.
1	Liraglutide delayed Tmax for both ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel by 1.5 h. Digoxin A single dose of digoxin 1 mg was administered 7 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state.
1	The concomitant administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of digoxin AUC by 16%; Cmax decreased by 31%.
1	Digoxin median time to maximal concentration (Tmax) was delayed from 1 h to 1.5 h. Lisinopril A single dose of lisinopril 20 mg was administered 5 minutes after the dose of liraglutide at steady state.
1	The co-administration with liraglutide resulted in a reduction of lisinopril AUC by 15%; Cmax decreased by 27%.
1	Lisinopril median Tmax was delayed from 6 h to 8 h with liraglutide.
0	Atorvastatin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of atorvastatin following a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg, administered 5 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state.
1	Atorvastatin Cmax was decreased by 38% and median Tmax was delayed from 1 h to 3 h with liraglutide.
0	Acetaminophen Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of acetaminophen following a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg, administered 8 hours after the dose of liraglutide at steady state.
1	Acetaminophen Cmax was decreased by 31% and median Tmax was delayed up to 15 minutes.
0	Griseofulvin Liraglutide did not change the overall exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin following co-administration of a single dose of griseofulvin 500 mg with liraglutide at steady state.
1	Griseofulvin Cmax increased by 37% while median Tmax did not change.
0	Insulin Detemir No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between liraglutide and insulin detemir when separate subcutaneous injections of insulin detemir 0.5 Unit/kg (single-dose) and liraglutide 1.8 mg (steady state) were administered to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
0	Tolbutamide tablets are contraindicated in patients with: Known hypersensitivity or allergy to the drug.
0	Diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma.
0	This condition should be treated with insulin.
0	There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with tolbutamide tablets or any other hypoglycemic agent.
0	In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.
0	Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be of value in monitoring the patient's response to therapy.
0	Short-term administration of tolbutamide tablets may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.
0	The usual starting dose is 1 to 2 grams daily.
0	This may be increased or decreased, depending on individual patient response.
0	Failure to follow an appropriate dosage regimen may precipitate hypoglycemia.
0	Patients who do not adhere to their prescribed dietary regimens are more prone to exhibit unsatisfactory response to drug therapy.
0	Transfer of patients from other oral antidiabetes regimens to tolbutamide tablets should be done conservatively.
0	When transferring patients from oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to tolbutamide, no transition period and no initial or priming doses are necessary.
0	When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, however, particular care should be exercised during the first 2 weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide, in the body and the possibility that subsequent overlapping drug effects might provoke hypoglycemia.
0	Patients requiring 20 units or less of insulin daily may be placed directly on tolbutamide tablets and insulin abruptly discontinued.
0	Patients whose insulin requirement is between 20 and 40 units daily may be started on therapy with tolbutamide tablets with a concurrent 30% to 50% reduction in insulin dose, with further daily reduction of the insulin when response to tolbutamide tablets is observed.
0	In patients requiring more than 40 units of insulin daily, therapy with tolbutamide tablets may be initiated in conjunction with a 20% reduction in insulin dose the first day, with further careful reduction of insulin as response is observed.
0	Occasionally, conversion to tolbutamide tablets in the hospital may be advisable in candidates who require more than 40 units of insulin daily.
0	During this conversion period when both insulin and tolbutamide tablets are being used hypoglycemia may rarely occur.
0	During insulin withdrawal, patients should test their urine for glucose and acetone at least 3 times daily and report results to their physician.
0	The appearance of persistent acetonuria with glycosuria indicates that the patient is type I diabetic who requires insulin therapy.
0	Daily doses of greater than 3 grams are not recommended.
0	The maintenance dose is in the range of 0.25 to 3 grams daily.
0	Maintenance doses above 2 grams are seldom required.
0	The total daily dose may be taken either in the morning or in divided doses through the day.
0	While either schedule is usually effective, the divided dose system is preferred by some clinicians from the standpoint of digestive tolerance.
0	In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions.
0	The hypoglycemia action of sulfonylurea may be potentiated by certain drugs including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and beta-adrenergic blocking agents.
0	When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving tolbutamide, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.
0	When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving tolbutamide, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control.
0	Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control.
0	These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.
0	When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving tolbutamide, the patient should be closely observed for loss of control.
0	When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving tolbutamide, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.
0	A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported.
0	Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known.
0	All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia.
0	Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes.
0	Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated blood levels of tolbutamide and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions.
0	Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs.
0	Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.
0	Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used.
0	When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a loss of control may occur.
0	At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue tolbutamide and administer insulin.
0	The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including tolbutamide, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug.
0	This phenomenon is known as a secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given.
0	Adequate adjustment of dose and adherence to diet should be assessed before classifying a patient as a secondary failure.
0	Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia.
0	Because tolbutamide belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered.
0	In post-marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.
0	Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of tolbutamide and of alternative modes of therapy.
0	They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.
0	The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members.
0	Primary and secondary failure should also be explained.
0	Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically.
0	Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin may be useful.
0	A metabolite of tolbutamide in urine may give a false positive reaction for albumin if measured by the acidification-after-boiling test, which causes the metabolite to precipitate.
0	There is no interference with the sulfosalicylic acid test.
0	Bioassay for carcinogenicity was performed in both sexes of rats and mice following ingestion of tolbutamide for 78 weeks.
0	No evidence of carcinogenicity was found.
0	Tolbutamide has also been demonstrated to be nonmutagenic in the Ames salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity test.
0	Tolbutamide has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in doses 25 to 100 times the human dose.
0	In some studies, pregnant rats given high doses of tolbutamide have shown ocular and bony abnormalities and increased mortality in offspring.
0	Repeat studies in other species (rabbits) have not demonstrated a teratogenic effect.
0	There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.
0	Tolbutamide is not recommended for the treatment of pregnant diabetic patients.
0	Serious consideration should also be given to the possible hazards of the use of tolbutamide in women of childbearing age and in those who might become pregnant while using the drug.
0	Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.
0	Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery.
0	This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-lives.
0	If tolbutamide is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least 2 weeks before the expected delivery date.
0	Although it is not known whether tolbutamide is excreted in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk.
0	Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
0	If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.
0	Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
0	The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin.
0	This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
0	The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (Diabetes, 19 (supp.2):747-830, 1970).
0	UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2<U+00BD> times that of patients treated with diet alone.
0	A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality.
0	Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning.
0	The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of tolbutamide and of alternative modes of therapy.
0	Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.
0	Tolbutamide appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets.
0	The mechanism by which tolbutamide lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established.
0	With chronic administration in Type II diabetic patients, the blood-glucose-lowering effect persists despite a gradual decline in the insulin secretory response to the drug.
0	Extrapancreatic effects may be involved in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.
0	Some patients who are initially responsive to oral hypoglycemic drugs, including tolbutamide, may become unresponsive or poorly responsive over time.
0	Alternatively, tolbutamide may be effective in some patients who have become unresponsive to one or more of the other sulfonylurea drugs.
0	When administered orally, tolbutamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
0	Absorption is not impaired and glucose lowering and insulin releasing effects are not altered if the drug is taken with food.
0	Detectable levels are present in the plasma within 20 minutes after oral ingestion of a 500 mg tolbutamide tablet, with peak levels occurring at 3 to 4 hours and only small amounts detectable at 24 hours.
0	The half-life of tolbutamide is 4.5 to 6.5 hours.
0	As tolbutamide has no p-amino group, it cannot be acetylated, which is one of the common modes of metabolic degradation for the antibacterial sulfonamides.
0	However, the presence of the p-methyl group renders tolbutamide susceptible to oxidation, and this appears to be the principal manner of its metabolic degradation in man.
0	The p-methyl group is oxidized to form a carboxyl group, converting tolbutamide into the totally inactive metabolite 1-butyl-3-p-carboxy-phenylsulfonylurea, which can be recovered in the urine within 24 hours in amounts accounting for up to 75% of the administered dose.
0	The major tolbutamide metabolite has been found to have no hypoglycemic or other action when administered orally and IV to both normal and diabetic subjects.
0	This tolbutamide metabolite is highly soluble over the critical acid range of urinary pH values, and its solubility increases with increase in pH.
0	Because of the marked solubility of the tolbutamide metabolite, crystalluria does not occur.
0	A second metabolite, 1-butyl-3-(p-hydroxymethyl) phenyl sulfonylurea also occurs to a limited extent.
0	The administration of 3 grams of tolbutamide to either nondiabetic or tolbutamide-responsive diabetic subjects will, in both instances, occasion a gradual lowering of blood glucose.
0	Increasing the dose to 6 grams does not usually cause a response which is significantly different from that produced by the 3 gram dose.
0	Following the administration of a 3 gram dose of tolbutamide solution, non-diabetic fasting adults exhibit a 30% or greater reduction in blood glucose within one hour, following which the blood glucose gradually returns to the fasting level over 6 to 12 hours.
0	Following the administration of a 3 gram dose of tolbutamide solution, tolbutamide responsive diabetic patients show a gradually progressive blood glucose lowering effect, the maximal response being reached between 5 to 8 hours after ingestion of a single 3 gram dose.
0	The blood glucose then rises gradually and by the 24th hour has usually returned to pretest levels.
0	The magnitude of the reduction, when expressed in terms of percent of the pretest blood glucose, tends to be similar to the response seen in the nondiabetic subject.
0	Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal<U+2014>Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy.
0	When discontinuing chronically administered nadolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored.
0	If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol administration should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken.
0	Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice.
0	Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue nadolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.
0	Nadolol is contraindicated in bronchial asthma, sinus bradycardia and greater than first degree conduction block, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure.
0	Bendroflumethiazide is contraindicated in anuria.
0	It is also contraindicated in patients who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to bendroflumethiazide or other sulfonamide-derived drugs.
0	DOSAGE MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED.
0	CORZIDE MAY BE ADMINISTERED WITHOUT REGARD TO MEALS.
0	Bendroflumethiazide is usually given at a dose of 5 mg daily.
0	The usual initial dose of nadolol is 40 mg once daily whether used alone or in combination with a diuretic.
0	Bendroflumethiazide in CORZIDE is 30 percent more bioavailable than that of 5 mg Naturetin tablets.
0	Conversion from 5 mg NATURETIN to CORZIDE represents a 30 percent increase in dose of bendroflumethiazide.
0	The initial dose of CORZIDE (Nadolol and Bendroflumethiazide Tablets) may therefore be the 40 mg/5 mg tablet once daily.
0	When the antihypertensive response is not satisfactory, the dose may be increased by administering the 80 mg/5 mg tablet once daily.
0	When necessary, another antihypertensive agent may be added gradually beginning with 50 percent of the usual recommended starting dose to avoid an excessive fall in blood pressure.
0	Dosage Adjustment in Renal Failure<U+2014>Absorbed nadolol is excreted principally by the kidneys and, although nonrenal elimination does occur, dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment.
0	The following dose intervals are recommended: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73 m2) Dosage Interval (hours) >50 24 31<U+2013>50 24<U+2013>36 10<U+2013>30 24<U+2013>48 <10 40<U+2013>60
0	Bendroflumethiazide may produce false-negative results with the phentolamine and tyramine tests; may interfere with the phenolsulfonphthalein test due to decreased excretion; and it may cause diagnostic interference of serum electrolyte levels, blood and urine glucose levels, and a decrease in serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.
0	When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents: Anesthetics, general<U+2014>exaggeration of the hypotension induced by general anesthetics.
0	Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)<U+2014>hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia; adjust dosage of antidiabetic drug accordingly.
0	Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine)<U+2014>additive effect; monitor closely for evidence of hypotension and/or excessive bradycardia (e.g., vertigo, syncope, postural hypotension).
0	Digitalis glycosides<U+2014>Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate.
0	Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.
0	Response to Treatment for Anaphylactic Reaction<U+2014>While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic.
0	Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.
0	When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics<U+2014>potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.
0	Amphotericin B, corticosteroids, or corticotropin (ACTH)<U+2014>may intensify electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia.
0	Monitor potassium levels; use potassium replacements if necessary.
0	Anticoagulants (oral)<U+2014>dosage adjustments of anticoagulant medication may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may decrease their effects.
0	Antigout medications<U+2014>dosage adjustments of antigout medication may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may raise the level of blood uric acid.
0	Other antihypertensive medications (e.g., ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking agents)<U+2014>dosage adjustments may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may potentiate their effects.
0	Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)<U+2014>since thiazides may elevate blood glucose levels, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be necessary.
1	Calcium salts<U+2014>increased serum calcium levels due to decreased excretion may occur.
0	If calcium must be prescribed monitor serum calcium levels and adjust calcium dosage accordingly.
0	Cardiac glycosides<U+2014>enhanced possibility of digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia.
0	Monitor potassium levels; use potassium replacement if necessary.
1	Cholestyramine resin and colestipol HCl<U+2014>may delay or decrease absorption of bendroflumethiazide.
0	Sulfonamide diuretics should be taken at least one hour before or four to six hours after these medications.
0	Diazoxide<U+2014>enhanced hyperglycemic, hyperuricemic, and antihypertensive effects.
0	Be cognizant of possible interaction; monitor blood glucose and serum uric acid levels.
1	Lithium salts<U+2014>may enhance lithium toxicity due to reduced renal clearance.
0	Avoid concurrent use; if lithium must be prescribed monitor serum lithium levels and adjust lithium dosage accordingly.
0	MAO inhibitors<U+2014>dosage adjustments of one or both agents may be necessary since hypotensive effects are enhanced.
0	Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, preanesthetics and anesthetics used in surgery (e.g., tubocurarine chloride and gallamine triethiodide)<U+2014>effects of these agents may be potentiated; dosage adjustments may be required.
0	Monitor and correct any fluid and electrolyte imbalances prior to surgery if feasible.
0	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents<U+2014>in some patients, the administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of loop, potassium-sparing or thiazide diuretics.
0	Therefore, when bendroflumethiazide and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
0	Methenamine<U+2014>possible decreased effectiveness due to alkalinization of the urine.
0	Pressor amines (e.g., norepinephrine)<U+2014>decreased arterial responsiveness, but not sufficient to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.
0	Use caution in patients taking both medications who undergo surgery.
0	Administer preanesthetic and anesthetic agents in reduced dosage, and if possible, discontinue bendroflumethiazide one week prior to surgery.
0	Probenecid or sulfinpyrazone<U+2014>increased dosage of these agents may be necessary since bendroflumethiazide may have hyperuricemic effects.
0	Nadolol should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function.
0	Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals.
0	All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance, namely: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia.
0	Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids.
0	Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance may include: dryness of the mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea and vomiting.
0	Hypokalemia may develop, especially with brisk diuresis or when severe cirrhosis is present.
0	Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia.
0	Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability).
0	Concurrent administration of a potassium-sparing diuretic or potassium supplements may be indicated in these patients.
0	Any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment except under extraordinary circumstances (as in liver disease or renal disease).
0	Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather; appropriate therapy is water restriction, rather than administration of salt, except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life-threatening.
0	In actual salt depletion, appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice.
0	Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.
0	Latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide administration.
0	The antihypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics may be enhanced in the postsympathectomy patient.
0	If progressive renal impairment becomes evident, as indicated by a rising nonprotein nitrogen or blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a careful reappraisal of therapy is necessary with consideration given to withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy.
0	Thiazides may decrease serum PBI levels without signs of thyroid disturbance.
1	Calcium excretion is decreased by thiazides.
0	Pathological changes in the parathyroid gland with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed in a few patients on prolonged thiazide therapy.
0	The common complications of hyperparathyroidism such as renal lithiasis, bone resorption, and peptic ulceration have not been seen.
0	Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.
0	Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.
0	Patients, especially those with evidence of coronary artery insufficiency, should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice.
0	Although cardiac failure rarely occurs in properly selected patients, patients being treated with beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be advised to consult the physician at the first sign or symptom of impending failure.
0	The patient should also be advised of a proper course in the event of an inadvertently missed dose.
0	The patient should be informed of symptoms that would suggest potential adverse effects and told to report them promptly.
0	Serum electrolyte levels should be regularly monitored.
0	In chronic oral toxicologic studies (one to two years) in mice, rats, and dogs, nadolol did not produce any significant toxic effects.
0	In two-year oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, nadolol did not produce any neoplastic, preneoplastic, or nonneoplastic pathologic lesions.
0	In fertility and general reproductive performance studies in rats, nadolol caused no adverse effect.
0	Studies have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenesis, or whether this drug adversely affects fertility in males or females.
0	In animal reproduction studies with nadolol, evidence of embryo-and fetotoxicity was found in rabbits, but not in rats or hamsters, at doses 5 to 10 times greater (on a mg/kg basis) than the maximum indicated human dose.
0	No teratogenic potential was observed in any of these species.
0	There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
0	Nadolol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
0	Neonates whose mothers are receiving nadolol at parturition have exhibited bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and associated symptoms.
0	Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with bendroflumethiazide.
0	It is also not known whether this drug can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.
0	Bendroflumethiazide should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
0	Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood.
0	The use of thiazides in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus.
0	These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult.
0	Both nadolol and bendroflumethiazide are excreted in human milk.
0	Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from both drugs, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy taking into account the importance of CORZIDE (Nadolol and Bendroflumethiazide Tablets) to the mother.
0	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.
0	Clinical studies of Corzide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
0	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
0	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
0	This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reaction to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired function.
0	Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.
0	Cardiac Failure <U+2014>Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta-blockade may precipitate more severe failure.
0	Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, they can be used with caution in patients with a history of failure who are well compensated, usually with digitalis and diuretics.
0	Beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle.
0	IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF HEART FAILURE, continued use of beta-blockers can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure.
0	Therefore, at the first sign or symptom of heart failure, the patient should be digitalized and/or treated with diuretics, and the response observed closely, or nadolol should be discontinued (gradually, if possible).
0	Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema) <U+2014> PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS.
0	Nadolol should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2 receptors.
0	Major Surgery <U+2014>Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.
0	Diabetes and Hypoglycemia <U+2014>Beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of premonitory signs and symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and blood pressure changes) of acute hypoglycemia.
0	This is especially important with labile diabetics.
0	Beta-blockade also reduces the release of insulin in response to hyperglycemia; therefore, it may be necessary to adjust the dose of antidiabetic drugs.
0	Thyrotoxicosis <U+2014>Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs (e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism.
0	Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blockade which might precipitate a thyroid storm.
0	Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease.
0	In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia.
0	Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function.
0	Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.
0	Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.
0	The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported.
1	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics; diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
0	Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.
0	Nadolol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent.
0	Clinical pharmacology studies have demonstrated beta-blocking activity by showing (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and on exercise, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia.
0	Nadolol specifically competes with beta-adrenergic receptor agonists for available beta receptor sites; it inhibits both the beta1 receptors located chiefly in cardiac muscle and the beta2 receptors located chiefly in the bronchial and vascular musculature, inhibiting the chronotropic, inotropic, and vasodilator responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation proportionately.
0	Nadolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and, unlike some other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, nadolol has little direct myocardial depressant activity and does not have an anesthetic-like membrane-stabilizing action.
0	Animal and human studies show that nadolol slows the sinus rate and depresses AV conduction.
0	In dogs, only minimal amounts of nadolol were detected in the brain relative to amounts in blood and other organs and tissues.
0	Nadolol has low lipophilicity as determined by octanol/water partition coefficient, a characteristic of certain beta-blocking agents that has been correlated with the limited extent to which these agents cross the blood-brain barrier, their low concentration in the brain, and low incidence of CNS-related side effects.
0	In controlled clinical studies, nadolol at doses of 40 to 320 mg/day has been shown to decrease both standing and supine blood pressure, the effect persisting for approximately 24 hours after dosing.
0	The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents has not been established; however, factors that may be involved include (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (non-CNS) adrenergic neuron sites (especially cardiac) leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) a central effect leading to reduced tonic-sympathetic nerve outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin secretion by blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptors responsible for renin release from the kidneys.
0	While cardiac output and arterial pressure are reduced by nadolol therapy, renal hemodynamics are stable, with preservation of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.
0	By blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and blood pressure, nadolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the long-term management of angina pectoris.
0	On the other hand, nadolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure.
0	Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in treatment of angina and hypertension, there are also situations in which sympathetic stimulation is vital.
0	For example, in patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive.
0	Beta-adrenergic blockade may worsen AV block by preventing the necessary facilitating effects of sympathetic activity on conduction.
0	Beta2-adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity in patients subject to bronchospasm and may also interfere with exogenous bronchodilators in such patients.
0	Absorption of nadolol after oral dosing is variable, averaging about 30 percent.
0	Peak serum concentrations of nadolol usually occur in three to four hours after oral administration and the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract does not affect the rate or extent of nadolol absorption.
0	Approximately 30 percent of the nadolol present in serum is reversibly bound to plasma protein.
0	Unlike many other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, nadolol is not metabolized by the liver and is excreted unchanged, principally by the kidneys.
0	The half-life of therapeutic doses of nadolol is about 20 to 24 hours, permitting once-daily dosage.
0	Because nadolol is excreted predominantly in the urine, its half-life increases in renal failure.
0	Steady state serum concentrations of nadolol are attained in six to nine days with once-daily dosage in persons with normal renal function.
0	Because of variable absorption and different individual responsiveness, the proper dosage must be determined by titration.
0	Exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease.
0	Abrupt withdrawal of these agents in patients without coronary artery disease has resulted in transient symptoms, including tremulousness, sweating, palpitation, headache, and malaise.
0	Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, among them increased sensitivity to catecholamines because of increased numbers of beta receptors.
0	The mechanism of action of bendroflumethiazide results in an interference with the renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption.
0	At maximal therapeutic dosage all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic potency.
0	Thiazides increase excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts.
0	Natriuresis causes a secondary loss of potassium and bicarbonate.
0	The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.
0	Thiazides do not affect normal blood pressure.
0	Onset of action of thiazides occurs in two hours and the peak effect at about four hours.
0	Duration of action persists for approximately six to 12 hours.
0	Thiazides are eliminated rapidly by the kidney.

0	Hypercalcemia in patients with PC or hypercalcemia in patients with primary HPT (2.3):<U+25CB> Starting dose is 30 mg twice daily.<U+25CB> Titrate dose every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg twice daily, 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg three or four times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels.
0	Once the maintenance dose has been established, monitor serum calcium approximately monthly for patients with secondary HPT and every 2 months for patients with PC or primary HPT (2.4) Sensipar should be taken with food or shortly after a meal.
0	Sensipar tablets are administered orally and should always be taken whole and not chewed, crushed, or divided.

0	Clinical studies indicate that Sensipar-treated patients with CKD not on dialysis have an increased risk for hypocalcemia compared with Sensipar-treated patients with CKD on dialysis, which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels.
0	In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 patients with CKD not on dialysis (302 cinacalcet, 102 placebo), in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60 mg per day at the completion of the study, 80% of Sensipar-treated patients experienced at least one serum calcium value < 8.4 mg/dL compared with 5% of patients receiving placebo.
0	QT Interval Prolongation and V entricular A rr h ythmia Decreases in serum calcium can also prolong the QT interval, potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia.
0	Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia have been reported in patients treated with Sensipar.
0	Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, history of QT interval prolongation, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia may be at increased risk for QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias if they develop hypocalcemia due to Sensipar.
0	Closely monitor corrected serum calcium and QT interval in patients at risk receiving Sensipar.
0	Seizures In clinical studies, seizures (primarily generalized or tonic-clonic) were observed in 1.4% (43/3049) of Sensipar-treated patients and 0.7% (5/687) of placebo-treated patients.

0	Monitor patients for worsening of common GI adverse reactions of nausea and vomiting associated with Sensipar and for signs and symptoms of GI bleeding and ulcerations during Sensipar therapy.
0	Promptly evaluate and treat any suspected GI bleeding.
0	In postmarketing safety surveillance, isolated, idiosyncratic cases of hypotension, worsening heart failure, and/or arrhythmia have been reported in patients with impaired cardiac function, in which a causal relationship to Sensipar could not be completely excluded and which may be mediated by reductions in serum calcium levels.
0	Adynamic bone disease may develop if iPTH levels are suppressed below 100 pg/mL.
0	One clinical study evaluated bone histomorphometry in patients treated with Sensipar for 1 year.
0	Three patients with mild hyperparathyroid bone disease at the beginning of the study developed adynamic bone disease during treatment with Sensipar.

0	In three 6-month, phase 3 studies conducted in patients with CKD on dialysis, 11% of patients treated with Sensipar had mean iPTH values below 100 pg/mL during the efficacy-assessment phase.
0	If iPTH levels decrease below 150 pg/mL in patients treated with Sensipar, the dose of Sensipar and/or vitamin D sterols should be reduced or therapy discontinued.
0	The calcium-sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of PTH synthesis and secretion.
0	Cinacalcet, the active ingredient in Sensipar, directly lowers PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor to extracellular calcium.
0	The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels.
0	Reduction in iPTH levels correlated with the plasma cinacalcet concentrations in patients with CKD.
0	The nadir in iPTH level occurs approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose, corresponding with the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of cinacalcet.
0	After steady-state cinacalcet concentrations are reached (which occurs within 7 days of dose change), serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval in patients with CKD.
0	Reductions in PTH are associated with a decrease in bone turnover and bone fibrosis in patients with CKD on dialysis and uncontrolled secondary HPT.
0	Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of cinacalcet, Cmax is achieved in approximately 2 to 6 hours.

0	Metabolism and Excretion Cinacalcet is metabolized by multiple enzymes, primarily CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2.
0	After administration of a 75 mg radiolabeled dose to healthy volunteers, cinacalcet was metabolized via: 1) oxidative N-dealkylation to hydrocinnamic acid and hydroxy-hydrocinnamic acid, which are further metabolized via <U+03B2>-oxidation and glycine conjugation; the oxidative N-dealkylation process also generates metabolites that contain the naphthalene ring; and 2) oxidation of the naphthalene ring on the parent drug forming dihydrodiols, which are further conjugated with glucuronic acid.
0	The plasma concentrations of the major circulating metabolites, including the cinnamic acid derivatives and glucuronidated dihydrodiols, markedly exceed the parent drug concentrations.

1	Coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors, including protease inhibitors (except tipranavir/ritonavir) and delavirdine, will increase the concentration of SELZENTRY.
1	Coadministration with CYP3A inducers, including efavirenz, may decrease the concentration of SELZENTRY.
0	Coadministration with St. John<U+2019>s wort is not recommended.
0	Maraviroc is metabolized by CYP3A, and is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2.
0	The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp, and may be modulated by inhibitors of OATP1B1 and MRP2.
0	Therefore, a dosage adjustment may be required when maraviroc is coadministered with those drugs.
0	Concomitant use of maraviroc and St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or products containing St. John's wort is not recommended.
0	Coadministration of maraviroc with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease maraviroc concentrations and may result in suboptimal levels of maraviroc and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to maraviroc.
0	Additional drug interaction information is available.
0	Hepatotoxicity accompanied by severe rash or systemic allergic reaction, including potentially life-threatening events, has been reported.

0	Among reported cases of hepatitis, some were observed in the absence of allergic features or with no pre-existing hepatic disease.
0	Appropriate laboratory testing including ALT, AST, and bilirubin should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with SELZENTRY and at other time points during treatment as clinically indicated.
0	Hepatic laboratory parameters should be obtained in any patient who develops rash, or signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or allergic reaction.
0	Discontinuation of SELZENTRY should be considered in any patient with signs or symptoms of hepatitis, or with increased liver transaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms.

0	The cases were characterized by features including rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including hepatic failure.
0	Discontinue SELZENTRY and other suspected agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin or hypersensitivity reactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, malaise, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, lip swelling, eosinophilia).
0	Delay in stopping treatment with SELZENTRY or other suspect drugs after the onset of rash may result in a life-threatening reaction.
0	Clinical status, including liver aminotransferases, should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated.
0	Eleven subjects (1.3%) who received SELZENTRY had cardiovascular events, including myocardial ischemia and/or infarction, during the Phase 3 trials in treatment-experienced subjects (total exposure 609 patient-years [300 on SELZENTRY once daily + 309 on SELZENTRY twice daily]), while no subjects who received placebo had such events (total exposure 111 patient-years).
0	These subjects generally had cardiac disease or cardiac risk factors prior to use of SELZENTRY, and the relative contribution of SELZENTRY to these events is not known.
0	In the Phase 2b/3 trial in treatment-naive adult subjects, 3 subjects (0.8%) who received SELZENTRY had events related to ischemic heart disease and 5 subjects (1.4%) who received efavirenz had such events (total exposure 506 and 508 patient-years for SELZENTRY and efavirenz, respectively).
0	When SELZENTRY was administered to healthy volunteers at doses higher than the recommended dose, symptomatic postural hypotension was seen at a greater frequency than in placebo.
0	However, when SELZENTRY was given at the recommended dose in HIV-1-infected adult subjects in Phase 3 trials, postural hypotension was seen at a rate similar to placebo (approximately 0.5%).
0	Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, risk factors for postural hypotension, or receiving concomitant medication known to lower blood pressure, could be at increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events triggered by postural hypotension.
0	Postural Hypotension in Patients with Renal Impairment An increased risk of postural hypotension may occur in patients with severe renal insufficiency or in those with ESRD due to increased maraviroc exposure in some patients.
0	SELZENTRY should be used in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD only if they are not receiving a concomitant potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer.
0	However, the use of SELZENTRY in these patients should only be considered when no alternative treatment options are available.
0	If adult patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking 300 mg twice daily, the dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice daily.
0	Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, including SELZENTRY.
0	During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections (such as infection with Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [PCP], tuberculosis, or reactivation of Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
0	Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves<U+2019> disease, polymyositis, and Guillain-Barr<U+00C3><U+00A9> syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution; however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
0	SELZENTRY antagonizes the CCR5 co-receptor located on some immune cells, and therefore could potentially increase the risk of developing infections.
0	The overall incidence and severity of infection, as well as AIDS-defining category C infections, were comparable in the treatment groups during the Phase 3 adult treatment-experienced trials of SELZENTRY.
0	While there was a higher rate of certain upper respiratory tract infections reported in the treatment arm receiving SELZENTRY compared with placebo (23% versus 13%), there was a lower rate of pneumonia (2% versus 5%) reported in subjects receiving SELZENTRY.
0	A higher incidence of Herpes virus infections (11 per 100 patient-years) was also reported in the treatment arm receiving SELZENTRY when adjusted for exposure compared with placebo (8 per 100 patient-years).
0	In the Phase 2b/3 trial in treatment-naive adult subjects, the incidence of AIDS-defining Category C events when adjusted for exposure was 1.8 for SELZENTRY compared with 2.4 for efavirenz per 100 patient-years of exposure.
0	Patients should be monitored closely for evidence of infections while receiving SELZENTRY.
0	While no increase in malignancy has been observed with SELZENTRY, due to this drug<U+2019>s mechanism of action, it could affect immune surveillance and lead to an increased risk of malignancy.
0	The exposure-adjusted rate for malignancies per 100 patient-years of exposure in adult treatment-experienced trials was 4.6 for SELZENTRY compared with 9.3 on placebo.
0	In treatment-naive adult subjects, the rates were 1.0 and 2.4 per 100 patient-years of exposure for SELZENTRY and efavirenz, respectively.
0	Long-term follow-up is needed to more fully assess this risk.
0	Maraviroc is an HIV-1 antiviral drug.
0	Exposure-Response Relationship in Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects The relationship between maraviroc, modeled plasma trough concentration (Cmin) (1 to 9 samples per subject taken on up to 7 visits), and virologic response was evaluated in 973 treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected subjects with varied optimized background antiretroviral regimens in Trials A4001027 and A4001028.
0	The Cmin, baseline viral load, baseline CD4+ cell count, and overall sensitivity score (OSS) were found to be important predictors of virologic success (defined as viral load less than 400 copies per mL at 24 weeks).

0	The pharmacokinetics of oral maraviroc are not dose proportional over the dose range.
0	The absolute bioavailability of a 100<U+2011>mg dose is 23% and is predicted to be 33% at 300 mg. Maraviroc is a substrate for the efflux transporter P-gp.
1	Effect of Food on Oral Absorption: Coadministration of a 300<U+2011>mg tablet with a high<U+2011>fat breakfast reduced maraviroc Cmax and AUC by 33% and coadministration of 75 mg of oral solution with a high-fat breakfast reduced maraviroc AUC by 73% in healthy adult volunteers.
0	Studies with the tablet formulation demonstrated a reduced food effect at higher doses.
0	There were no food restrictions in the adult trials (using the tablet formulation) or in the pediatric trial (using both tablet and oral solution formulations) that demonstrated the efficacy/antiviral activity and safety of maraviroc.
0	Distribution Maraviroc is bound (approximately 76%) to human plasma proteins, and shows moderate affinity for albumin and alpha<U+2011>1 acid glycoprotein.
0	The volume of distribution of maraviroc is approximately 194 L. Elimination Metabolism: Trials in humans and in vitro studies using human liver microsomes and expressed enzymes have demonstrated that maraviroc is principally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system to metabolites that are essentially inactive against HIV<U+2011>1.
0	In vitro studies indicate that CYP3A is the major enzyme responsible for maraviroc metabolism.
0	In vitro studies also indicate that polymorphic enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 do not contribute significantly to the metabolism of maraviroc.
0	Maraviroc is the major circulating component (~42% drug<U+2011>related radioactivity) following a single oral dose of 300 mg [14C]-maraviroc.
0	The most significant circulating metabolite in humans is a secondary amine (~22% radioactivity) formed by N<U+2011>dealkylation.
0	This polar metabolite has no significant pharmacological activity.
0	Other metabolites are products of mono<U+2011>oxidation and are only minor components of plasma drug<U+2011>related radioactivity.
0	Excretion: The terminal half<U+2011>life of maraviroc following oral dosing to steady state in healthy subjects was 14 to 18 hours.
0	A mass balance/excretion trial was conducted using a single 300<U+2011>mg dose of 14C-labeled maraviroc.
0	Approximately 20% of the radiolabel was recovered in the urine and 76% was recovered in the feces over 168 hours.
0	Maraviroc was the major component present in urine (mean of 8% dose) and feces (mean of 25% dose).
0	The remainder was excreted as metabolites.
0	Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Maraviroc is primarily metabolized and eliminated by the liver.
0	A trial compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300<U+2011>mg dose of SELZENTRY in subjects with mild (Child<U+2011>Pugh Class A, n = 8) and moderate (Child<U+2011>Pugh Class B, n = 8) hepatic impairment with pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects (n = 8).
0	The mean Cmax and AUC were 11% and 25% higher, respectively, for subjects with mild hepatic impairment, and 32% and 46% higher, respectively, for subjects with moderate hepatic impairment compared with subjects with normal hepatic function.
0	These changes do not warrant a dose adjustment.
0	Maraviroc concentrations are higher when SELZENTRY 150 mg is administered with a potent CYP3A inhibitor compared with following administration of 300 mg without a CYP3A inhibitor, so patients with moderate hepatic impairment who receive SELZENTRY 150 mg with a potent CYP3A inhibitor should be monitored closely for maraviroc<U+2011>associated adverse events.
0	The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc have not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.
0	Patients with Renal Impairment: A trial compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300<U+2011>mg dose of SELZENTRY in adult subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL per minute, n = 6) and ESRD (n = 6) with healthy volunteers (n = 6).
0	Geometric mean ratios for maraviroc Cmax and AUCinf were 2.4<U+2011>fold and 3.2<U+2011>fold higher, respectively, for subjects with severe renal impairment, and 1.7<U+2011>fold and 2.0<U+2011>fold higher, respectively, for subjects with ESRD as compared with subjects with normal renal function in this trial.
0	Hemodialysis had a minimal effect on maraviroc clearance and exposure in subjects with ESRD.
0	Exposures observed in subjects with severe renal impairment and ESRD were within the range observed in previous 300<U+2011>mg single<U+2011>dose trials of SELZENTRY in healthy volunteers with normal renal function.
0	However, maraviroc exposures in the subjects with normal renal function in this trial were 50% lower than those observed in previous trials.
0	Based on the results of this trial, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment receiving SELZENTRY without a potent CYP3A inhibitor or inducer.
0	However, if patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD experience any symptoms of postural hypotension while taking SELZENTRY 300 mg twice daily, their dose should be reduced to 150 mg twice daily.
0	In addition, the trial compared the pharmacokinetics of multiple<U+2011>dose SELZENTRY in combination with saquinavir/ritonavir 1,000/100 mg twice daily (a potent CYP3A inhibitor combination) for 7 days in subjects with mild renal impairment (CrCl greater than 50 and less than or equal to 80 mL per minute, n = 6) and moderate renal impairment (CrCl greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 50 mL per minute, n = 6) with healthy volunteers with normal renal function (n = 6).

0	Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Concomitant Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Maraviroc: Maraviroc is a substrate of CYP3A and P-gp and hence its pharmacokinetics are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes/transporters.
1	The CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors ketoconazole, boceprevir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, saquinavir/ritonavir, and atazanavir <U+00B1> ritonavir all increased the Cmax and AUC of maraviroc (Table 14).
1	The CYP3A and/or P-gp inducers rifampin, etravirine, and efavirenz decreased the Cmax and AUC of maraviroc (Table 14).
1	While not studied, potent CYP3A and/or P-gp inducers carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin are expected to decrease maraviroc concentrations.
0	Based on in vitro study results, maraviroc is also a substrate of OATP1B1 and MRP2; its pharmacokinetics may be modulated by inhibitors of these transporters.
0	Tipranavir/ritonavir (net CYP3A inhibitor/P-gp inducer) did not affect the steady<U+2011>state pharmacokinetics of maraviroc (Table 14).

0	Maraviroc does not induce CYP1A2 in vitro.
0	Additionally, in vitro studies have shown that maraviroc is not a substrate for, and does not inhibit, any of the major renal uptake inhibitors (organic anion transporter [OAT]1, OAT3, organic cation transporter [OCT]2, novel organic cation transporter [OCTN]1, and OCTN2) at clinically relevant concentrations.
0	In vitro results suggest that maraviroc could inhibit P-gp in the gut.
0	However, maraviroc did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in vivo, indicating maraviroc may not significantly inhibit or induce P-gp clinically.
0	Drug interaction trials were performed with maraviroc and other drugs likely to be coadministered or commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions (Table 14).
1	Coadministration of fosamprenavir 700 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and maraviroc 300 mg twice daily decreased the Cmin and AUC of amprenavir by 36% and 35%, respectively.
1	Coadministration of fosamprenavir 1,400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg once daily and maraviroc 300 mg once daily decreased the Cmin and AUC by 15% and 30%, respectively.
0	No dosage adjustment is necessary when SELZENTRY is dosed 150 mg twice daily in combination with fosamprenavir/ritonavir dosed once or twice daily.
0	Fosamprenavir should be given with ritonavir when coadministered with SELZENTRY.
0	Maraviroc had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of elvitegravir, boceprevir, zidovudine, or lamivudine.
1	Maraviroc decreased the Cmin and AUC of raltegravir by 27% and 37%, respectively, which is not clinically significant.
0	Maraviroc had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, the oral contraceptives ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, no effect on the urinary 6<U+03B2>-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio, suggesting no induction of CYP3A in vivo.
0	Maraviroc had no effect on the debrisoquine metabolic ratio (MR) at 300 mg twice daily or less in vivo and did not cause inhibition of CYP2D6 in vitro until concentrations greater than 100 microM.
1	However, there was 234% increase in debrisoquine MR on treatment compared with baseline at 600 mg once daily, suggesting potential inhibition of CYP2D6 at higher doses.
0	Mechanism of Action Maraviroc is a member of a therapeutic class called CCR5 co-receptor antagonists.
0	Maraviroc selectively binds to the human chemokine receptor CCR5 present on the cell membrane, preventing the interaction of HIV-1 gp120 and CCR5 necessary for CCR5-tropic HIV-1 to enter cells.
0	CXCR4-tropic and dual-tropic HIV-1 entry is not inhibited by maraviroc.
0	Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Maraviroc inhibits the replication of CCR5-tropic laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 in models of acute peripheral blood leukocyte infection.
0	The mean EC50 value (50% effective concentration) for maraviroc against HIV-1 group M isolates (subtypes A to J and circulating recombinant form AE) and group O isolates ranged from 0.1 to 4.5 nM (0.05 to 2.3 ng per mL) in cell culture.
0	When used with other antiretroviral agents in cell culture, the combination of maraviroc was not antagonistic with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs: delavirdine, efavirenz, and nevirapine), NRTIs (abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine, tenofovir, zalcitabine, and zidovudine), or protease inhibitors (PIs: amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir).
0	Maraviroc was not antagonistic with the HIV-1 gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide.
0	Maraviroc was not active against CXCR4-tropic and dual-tropic viruses (EC50 value greater than 10 microM).
0	The antiviral activity of maraviroc against HIV-2 has not been evaluated.
0	Resistance in Cell Culture: HIV-1 variants with reduced susceptibility to maraviroc have been selected in cell culture following serial passage of 2 CCR5-tropic viruses (CCl/85 and RU570).
0	The maraviroc-resistant viruses remained CCR5-tropic with no evidence of a change from a CCR5-tropic virus to a CXCR4-using virus.
0	Two amino acid residue substitutions in the V3-loop region of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp160), A316T, and I323V (HXB2 numbering), were shown to be necessary for the maraviroc-resistant phenotype in the HIV-1 isolate CCl/85.
0	In the RU570 isolate a 3-amino acid residue deletion in the V3 loop, <U+0394>QAI (HXB2 positions 315 to 317), was associated with maraviroc resistance.
0	The relevance of the specific gp120 substitutions observed in maraviroc-resistant isolates selected in cell culture to clinical maraviroc resistance is not known.
0	Maraviroc-resistant viruses were characterized phenotypically by concentration-response curves that did not reach 100% inhibition in phenotypic drug assays, rather than increases in EC50 values.
0	Cross-Resistance in Cell Culture: Maraviroc had antiviral activity against HIV<U+2011>1 clinical isolates resistant to NNRTIs, NRTIs, PIs, and the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide in cell culture (EC50 values ranged from 0.7 to 8.9 nM [0.36 to 4.57 ng per mL]).
0	Maraviroc<U+2011>resistant viruses that emerged in cell culture remained susceptible to enfuvirtide and the protease inhibitor saquinavir.
0	Clinical Resistance: Virologic failure on maraviroc can result from genotypic and phenotypic resistance to maraviroc, through outgrowth of undetected CXCR4-using virus present before maraviroc treatment, through resistance to background therapy drugs (Table 15), or due to low exposure to maraviroc.
0	Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Adult Subjects (Trials A4001027 and A4001028): Week 48 data from treatment-experienced subjects failing maraviroc-containing regimens with CCR5-tropic virus (n = 58) have identified 22 viruses that had decreased susceptibility to maraviroc characterized in phenotypic drug assays by concentration-response curves that did not reach 100% inhibition.
0	Additionally, CCR5-tropic virus from 2 of these treatment-failure subjects had greater than or equal to 3-fold shifts in EC50 values for maraviroc at the time of failure.
0	Fifteen of these viruses were sequenced in the gp120 encoding region and multiple amino acid substitutions with unique patterns in the heterogeneous V3 loop region were detected.
0	Changes at either amino acid position 308 or 323 (HXB2 numbering) were seen in the V3 loop in 7 of the subjects with decreased maraviroc susceptibility.
0	Substitutions outside the V3 loop of gp120 may also contribute to reduced susceptibility to maraviroc.
0	Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Adult Subjects (Trial A4001026): Treatment-naive subjects receiving SELZENTRY had more virologic failures and more treatment-emergent resistance to the background regimen drugs compared with those receiving efavirenz (Table 15).
0	Development of Resistance to Maraviroc or Efavirenz and Background Drugs in Antiretroviral Treatment-Naive Trial A4001026 for Patients with Only CCR5-Tropic Virus at Screening Using Enhanced Sensitivity TROFILE Assay a Includes subjects failing with CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropism because these viruses are not intrinsically susceptible to maraviroc.

0	One additional subject had a greater than or equal to 3-fold shift in the EC50 value for maraviroc at the time of failure.
0	A clonal analysis of the V3 loop amino acid envelope sequences was performed from 6 of the 7 subjects.
0	Changes in V3 loop amino acid sequence differed between each of these different subjects, even for those infected with the same virus clade, suggesting that there are multiple diverse pathways to maraviroc resistance.
0	The subjects who failed with CCR5-tropic virus and without a detectable maraviroc shift in susceptibility were not evaluated for genotypic resistance.
0	Of the 32 maraviroc virologic failures failing with CCR5-tropic virus, 20 (63%) also had genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance to background drugs in the regimen (lamivudine, zidovudine).
0	Tropism: In both treatment-experienced and treatment-naive subjects, detection of CXCR4-using virus prior to initiation of therapy has been associated with a reduced virologic response to maraviroc.
0	Antiretroviral Treatment<U+2011>Experienced Subjects (Trials A4001027 and A4001028): In the majority of cases, treatment failure on maraviroc was associated with detection of CXCR4-using virus (i.e., CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic) which was not detected by the tropism assay prior to treatment.
0	CXCR4-using virus was detected at failure in approximately 55% of subjects who failed treatment on maraviroc by Week 48, as compared with 9% of subjects who experienced treatment failure in the placebo arm.
0	To investigate the likely origin of the on-treatment CXCR4-using virus, a detailed clonal analysis was conducted on virus from 20 representative subjects (16 subjects from the maraviroc arms and 4 subjects from the placebo arm) in whom CXCR4-using virus was detected at treatment failure.
0	From analysis of amino acid sequence differences and phylogenetic data, it was determined that CXCR4-using virus in these subjects emerged from a low level of pre-existing CXCR4-using virus not detected by the tropism assay (which is population-based) prior to treatment rather than from a co-receptor switch from CCR5-tropic virus to CXCR4-using virus resulting from mutation in the virus.
0	Detection of CXCR4-using virus prior to initiation of therapy has been associated with a reduced virological response to maraviroc.
0	Furthermore, subjects failing twice-daily maraviroc at Week 48 with CXCR4-using virus had a lower median increase in CD4+ cell counts from baseline (+41 cells per mm3) than those subjects failing with CCR5-tropic virus (+162 cells per mm3).
0	The median increase in CD4+ cell count in subjects failing in the placebo arm was +7 cells per mm3.
0	Antiretroviral Treatment<U+2011>Naive Subjects (Trial A4001026): In a 96-week trial of antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects, 14% (12 of 85) who had only CCR5-tropic virus at screening with an enhanced sensitivity tropism assay (TROFILE) and failed therapy on maraviroc had CXCR4-using virus at the time of treatment failure.
0	A detailed clonal analysis was conducted in 2 previously antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects enrolled in a Phase 2a monotherapy trial who had CXCR4-using virus detected after 10 days<U+2019> treatment with maraviroc.
0	Consistent with the detailed clonal analysis conducted in treatment-experienced subjects, the CXCR4-using variants appear to emerge from outgrowth of a pre-existing undetected CXCR4-using virus.
0	Screening with an enhanced sensitivity tropism assay reduced the number of maraviroc virologic failures with CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic virus at failure to 12 compared with 24 when screening with the original tropism assay.
0	All but one (11 of 12; 92%) of the maraviroc failures failing with CXCR4 or dual/mixed-tropic virus also had genotypic and phenotypic resistance to the background drug lamivudine at failure and 33% (4 of 12) developed zidovudine-associated resistance substitutions.
0	Subjects who had only CCR5-tropic virus at baseline and failed maraviroc therapy with CXCR4-using virus had a median increase in CD4+ cell counts from baseline of +113 cells per mm3 while those subjects failing with CCR5-tropic virus had an increase of +135 cells per mm3.
0	The median increase in CD4+ cell count in subjects failing in the efavirenz arm was +95 cells per mm3.
0	Antiretroviral Treatment-Experienced Pediatric Subjects (Trial A4001031): In the Week 48 analysis of Trial A4001031 (n = 103), the mechanisms of resistance to maraviroc observed in the treatment-experienced pediatric population were similar to those observed in adult populations: reasons for virologic failure included failing with CXCR4- or dual/mixed-tropic virus, evidence of reduced maraviroc susceptibility as measured by a decrease in maximal percentage inhibition (MPI), and emergence of resistance to background drug in the regimen.

0	In the study of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the assigned dose of 6 mg/kg once daily was reached at the end of 8 weeks.
0	The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as treatment for prophylaxis of migraine headache in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older is 100 mg once daily.
0	The recommended titration rate for QUDEXY XR for migraine prophylaxis to 100 mg/day is: Table 3: Migraine Prophylaxis Titration Schedule for Adults and Adolescents 12 years of Age and Older QUDEXY XR Once Daily Dose Week 1 25 mg Week 2 50 mg Week 3 75 mg Week 4 100 mg Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome.
0	In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m2), one-half of the usual adult dose is recommended.
0	Such patients will require a longer time to reach steady-state at each dose.
0	Prior to dosing, obtain an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) in patients at high risk for renal insufficiency (e.g., older patients, or those with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or autoimmune disease).
0	CrCl can be estimated using the following equation (multiply by 0.85 for women): CrCl = (140 <U+2013> age) <U+00D7> weight(kg) SerumCr(mg / dl) <U+00D7> 72 Topiramate is cleared by hemodialysis at a rate that is 4 to 6 times greater than in patients with normal renal function.
0	Accordingly, a prolonged period of dialysis may cause topiramate concentration to fall below that required to maintain an anti-seizure effect.
0	To avoid rapid drops in topiramate plasma concentration during hemodialysis, a supplemental dose of topiramate may be required.
0	The actual adjustment should take into account the: duration of dialysis period clearance rate of the dialysis system being used effective renal clearance of topiramate in the patient being dialyzed.
0	Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during QUDEXY XR treatment is recommended.
0	The co-administration of QUDEXY XR with phenytoin may require an adjustment of the dose of phenytoin to achieve optimal clinical outcome.
0	Addition or withdrawal of phenytoin and/or carbamazepine during adjunctive therapy with QUDEXY XR may require adjustment of the dose of QUDEXY XR.
0	It is not necessary to monitor topiramate plasma concentrations to optimize QUDEXY XR therapy.
0	QUDEXY XR capsules may be swallowed whole or may be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a small amount (teaspoon) of soft food.

0	Do not store drug/food mixture for further use.
0	QUDEXY XR can be taken without regard to meals.
0	Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions There are no known interactions of QUDEXY XR with commonly used laboratory tests.
0	Oral contraceptives: Decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding, especially at doses greater than 200 mg per day (7.1) Phenytoin or carbamazepine: Concomitant administration with topiramate decreased plasma concentrations of topiramate (7.2) Lithium: Monitor lithium levels when co-administered with high-dose topiramate (7.6) The possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding should be considered in patients taking combination oral contraceptive products with QUDEXY XR.
0	Patients taking estrogen-containing contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns.
0	Contraceptive efficacy can be decreased even in the absence of breakthrough bleeding.
1	Concomitant administration of phenytoin or carbamazepine with topiramate decreased plasma concentrations of topiramate.
0	Concomitant administration of valproic acid and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy.
0	Concomitant administration of topiramate with valproic acid has also been associated with hypothermia (with and without hyperammonemia) in patients who have tolerated either drug alone.
0	It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels in patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported.
0	Numerous AEDs are substrates of the CYP enzyme system.
0	In vitro studies indicate that topiramate does not inhibit enzyme activity for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4/5 isozymes.
0	In vitro studies indicate that immediate-release topiramate is a mild inhibitor of CYP2C19 and a mild inducer of CYP3A4.
0	The same drug interactions can be expected with the use of QUDEXY XR.
0	Concomitant administration of topiramate with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol can result in significant CNS depression.
0	Concomitant use of alcohol should be avoided.
0	Concomitant use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide), may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis and may also increase the risk of kidney stone formation.
0	Patients should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis when QUDEXY XR is given concomitantly with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.
0	Topiramate treatment can frequently cause metabolic acidosis, a condition for which the use of metformin is contraindicated.
0	The concomitant use of QUDEXY XR and metformin is contraindicated in patients with metabolic acidosis.
1	In patients, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure of lithium following topiramate doses of up to 600 mg per day.
0	Lithium levels should be monitored when co-administered with high-dose QUDEXY XR.
0	Acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma: Untreated elevated intraocular pressure can lead to permanent visual loss.
0	Discontinue QUDEXY XR if it occurs (5.1) Visual field defects: These have been reported independent of elevated intraocular pressure.
0	Consider discontinuation of QUDEXY XR (5.2) Oligohydrosis and hyperthermia: Monitor decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in pediatric patients (5.3) Metabolic acidosis: Measure baseline and periodic measurement of serum bicarbonate.
0	Consider dose reduction or discontinuation of QUDEXY XR if clinically appropriate (5.4) Suicidal behavior and ideation: Antiepileptic drugs increase the risk of suicidal behavior or ideation (5.5) Cognitive/neuropsychiatric: QUDEXY XR may cause cognitive dysfunction.
0	Use caution when operating machinery including automobiles.
0	Depression and mood problems may occur (5.6) Fetal toxicity: Topiramate use during pregnancy can cause cleft lip and/or palate and increases the risk of being small for gestational age (5.7) Withdrawal of AEDs: Withdrawal of QUDEXY XR should be done gradually (5.8) Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy: Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced mitochondrial activity may have an increased risk of hyperammonemia.
0	Measure ammonia if encephalopathic symptoms occur (5.9) Kidney stones: Avoid use with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, other drugs causing metabolic acidosis, or in patients on a ketogenic diet (5.10) Hypothermia: Reported with concomitant valproic acid use (5.11) A syndrome consisting of acute myopia associated with secondary angle closure glaucoma has been reported in patients receiving topiramate.
0	Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity and/or ocular pain.
0	Ophthalmologic findings can include myopia, anterior chamber shallowing, ocular hyperemia (redness) and increased intraocular pressure.
0	This syndrome may be associated with supraciliary effusion resulting in anterior displacement of the lens and iris, with secondary angle closure glaucoma.
0	Symptoms typically occur within 1 month of initiating topiramate therapy.
0	In contrast to primary narrow angle glaucoma, which is rare under 40 years of age, secondary angle closure glaucoma associated with topiramate has been reported in pediatric patients as well as adults.
0	The primary treatment to reverse symptoms is discontinuation of QUDEXY XR as rapidly as possible, according to the judgment of the treating physician.
0	Other measures, in conjunction with discontinuation of QUDEXY XR, may be helpful.
0	Elevated intraocular pressure of any etiology, if left untreated, can lead to serious sequelae including permanent vision loss.
0	Visual field defects have been reported in patients receiving topiramate independent of elevated intraocular pressure.
0	In clinical trials, most of these events were reversible after topiramate discontinuation.
0	If visual problems occur at any time during treatment with QUDEXY XR, consideration should be given to discontinuing the drug.
0	Oligohydrosis (decreased sweating), resulting in hospitalization in some cases, has been reported in association with topiramate use.
0	Decreased sweating and an elevation in body temperature above normal characterized these cases.
0	Some of the cases were reported after exposure to elevated environmental temperatures.
0	The majority of the reports have been in pediatric patients.
0	Patients, especially pediatric patients, treated with QUDEXY XR should be monitored closely for evidence of decreased sweating and increased body temperature, especially in hot weather.
0	Caution should be used when QUDEXY XR is prescribed with other drugs that predispose patients to heat-related disorders; these drugs include, but are not limited to, other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and drugs with anticholinergic activity.
0	Hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) is associated with topiramate treatment.
0	This metabolic acidosis is caused by renal bicarbonate loss due to the inhibitory effect of topiramate on carbonic anhydrase.
0	Such electrolyte imbalance has been observed with the use of topiramate in placebo-controlled clinical trials and in the post-marketing period.
0	Generally, topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis occurs early in treatment although cases can occur at any time during treatment.
0	Bicarbonate decrements are usually mild-moderate (average decrease of 4 mEq/L at daily doses of 400 mg in adults and at approximately 6 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients); rarely, patients can experience severe decrements to values below 10 mEq/L.
0	Conditions or therapies that predispose patients to acidosis (such as renal disease, severe respiratory disorders, status epilepticus, diarrhea, ketogenic diet or specific drugs) may be additive to the bicarbonate lowering effects of topiramate.
0	Manifestations of Metabolic Acidosis Some manifestations of acute or chronic metabolic acidosis may include hyperventilation, nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and anorexia, or more severe sequelae including cardiac arrhythmias or stupor.
0	Chronic, untreated metabolic acidosis may increase the risk for nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, and may also result in osteomalacia (referred to as rickets in pediatric patients) and/or osteoporosis with an increased risk for fractures.
0	Chronic metabolic acidosis in pediatric patients may also reduce growth rates.
0	A reduction in growth rate may eventually decrease the maximal height achieved.
0	The effect of topiramate on growth and bone-related sequelae has not been systematically investigated in long-term, placebo-controlled trials.
0	Long-term, open-label treatment of infants/toddlers, with intractable partial epilepsy, for up to 1 year, showed reductions from baseline in Z SCORES for length, weight, and head circumference compared to age and sex-matched normative data, although these patients are likely to have different growth rates than normal infants.
0	Reductions in Z SCORES for length and weight were correlated to the degree of acidosis.
0	Topiramate treatment that causes metabolic acidosis during pregnancy can possibly produce adverse effects on the fetus and might also cause metabolic acidosis in the neonate from possible transfer of topiramate to the fetus.
0	Epilepsy Adult Patients In adults, the incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate (levels of less than 20 mEq/L at two consecutive visits or at the final visit) in controlled clinical trials for adjunctive treatment of epilepsy was 32% for 400 mg per day, and 1% for placebo.
0	Metabolic acidosis has been observed at doses as low as 50 mg per day.
0	The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in the adjunctive therapy trials was 3% for 400 mg per day and 0% for placebo.
0	The incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate in adult patients (<U+2265>16 years of age) in the epilepsy controlled clinical trial for monotherapy was 14% for 50 mg per day and 25% for 400 mg per day.
0	The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in this trial for adults was 1% for 50 mg per day and 6% for 400 mg per day.
0	Serum bicarbonate levels have not been systematically evaluated at daily doses greater than 400 mg per day.
0	Pediatric Patients (2 years to 16 years of age) The incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate in placebo-controlled trials for adjunctive treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or refractory partial onset seizures in patients age 2 years to 16 years was 67% for topiramate (at approximately 6 mg/kg/day), and 10% for placebo.
0	The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was 11% for topiramate and 0% for placebo.
0	Cases of moderately severe metabolic acidosis have been reported in patients as young as 5 months old, especially at daily doses above 5 mg/kg/day.
0	In pediatric patients (6 years to 15 years of age), the incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate in the epilepsy controlled clinical trial for monotherapy performed with topiramate was 9% for 50 mg per day and 25% for 400 mg per day.
0	The incidence of a markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in this trial was 1% for 50 mg per day and 6% for 400 mg per day.
0	Pediatric Patients (under 2 years of age) Although QUDEXY XR is not approved for use in patients less than 2 years of age, a study of topiramate as adjunctive use in patients under 2 years of age with partial onset seizures revealed that topiramate produced a metabolic acidosis that is notably greater in magnitude than that observed in controlled trials in older children and adults.
0	The mean treatment difference (25 mg/kg/day topiramate-placebo) was -5.9 mEq/L for bicarbonate.
0	The incidence of metabolic acidosis (defined by a serum bicarbonate less than 20 mEq/L) was 0% for placebo, 30% for 5 mg/kg/day, 50% for 15 mg/kg/day, and 45% for 25 mg/kg/day.
0	The incidence of markedly abnormal changes (i.e., less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from baseline of greater than or equal to 20 mEq/L) was 0% for placebo, 4% for 5 mg/kg/day, 5% for 15 mg/kg/day and 5% for 25 mg/kg/day.
0	Migraine Adult Patients The incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate in placebo-controlled trials in adults for the prophylaxis of migraine was 44% for 200 mg/day, 39% for 100 mg/day, 23% for 50 mg/day, and 7% for placebo.
0	The incidence of markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value less than 17 mEq/L and greater than 5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) in these trials was 11% for 200 mg/day, 9% for 100 mg/day, 2% for 50 mg/day, and <1% for placebo.
0	Adolescent Patients In pooled, double-blind migraine prophylaxis studies in adolescent patients (12 to 17 years of age), the incidence of persistent decreases in serum bicarbonate was 77% for 200 mg/day, 27% for 100 mg/day, 30% for 50 mg/day, and 9% for placebo.
0	The incidence of markedly low serum bicarbonate (i.e., absolute value <17 mEq/L and >5 mEq/L decrease from pretreatment) was 6% for 100 mg/day, 2% for 50 mg/day, and 2% for placebo.
0	This bicarbonate criterion was not met by any patients in the 200 mg/day group, which had a low number of subjects (n=13).
0	Measurement of Serum Bicarbonate in Epilepsy and Migraine Patients Measurement of baseline and periodic serum bicarbonate during topiramate treatment is recommended.
0	If metabolic acidosis develops and persists, consideration should be given to reducing the dose or discontinuing topiramate (using dose tapering).
0	If the decision is made to continue patients on topiramate in the face of persistent acidosis, alkali treatment should be considered.
0	Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication.
0	Patients treated with any AED, including QUDEXY XR, for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.
0	Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo.
0	In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated.
0	There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.
0	The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed.
0	Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed.
0	The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.
0	The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication.
0	The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed.
0	Table 4 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs.
0	Table 4: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events per 1,000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.
0	Anyone considering prescribing QUDEXY XR or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness.
0	Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.
0	Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.
0	Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior or thoughts about self-harm.
0	Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.
0	Adverse reactions most often associated with the use of topiramate, and therefore expected to be associated with the use of QUDEXY XR, were related to the central nervous system and were observed in both the epilepsy and migraine populations.
0	In adults, the most frequent of these can be classified into three general categories: 1) Cognitive-related dysfunction (e.g. confusion, psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory, speech or language problems, particularly word-finding difficulties), 2) Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (e.g. depression or mood problems), and 3) Somnolence or fatigue.
0	Adult Patients Cognitive Related Dysfunction The majority of cognitive-related adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity, and they frequently occurred in isolation.
0	Rapid titration rate and higher initial dose were associated with higher incidences of these reactions.
0	Many of these reactions contributed to withdrawal from treatment.
0	In the adjunctive epilepsy controlled trials conducted with topiramate (using rapid titration such as 100 mg per day to 200 mg per day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 42% for 200 mg per day, 41% for 400 mg per day, 52% for 600 mg per day, 56% for 800 and 1,000 mg per day, and 14% for placebo.
0	These dose-related adverse reactions began with a similar frequency in the titration or in the maintenance phase, although in some patients the events began during titration and persisted into the maintenance phase.
0	Some patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions in the titration phase had a dose-related recurrence of these reactions in the maintenance phase.
0	In the monotherapy epilepsy controlled trial conducted with topiramate, the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg per day and 26% for 400 mg per day.
0	In the 6-month migraine prophylaxis controlled trials using a slower titration regimen (25 mg/day weekly increments), the proportion of patients who experienced one or more cognitive-related adverse reactions was 19% for topiramate 50 mg/day, 22% for 100 mg/day (the recommended dose), 28% for 200 mg/day, and 10% for placebo.
0	These dose-related adverse reactions typically began in the titration phase and often persisted into the maintenance phase, but infrequently began in the maintenance phase.
0	Some patients experienced a recurrence of one or more of these cognitive adverse reactions and this recurrence was typically in the titration phase.
0	A relatively small proportion of topiramate-treated patients experienced more than one concurrent cognitive adverse reaction.
0	The most common cognitive adverse reactions occurring together included difficulty with memory along with difficulty with concentration/attention, difficulty with memory along with language problems, and difficulty with concentration/attention along with language problems.
0	Rarely, topiramate-treated patients experienced three concurrent cognitive reactions.
0	Psychiatric/Behavioral Disturbances Psychiatric/behavioral disturbances (depression or mood) were dose-related for both the epilepsy and migraine populations treated with topiramate.
0	Somnolence/Fatigue Somnolence and fatigue were the adverse reactions most frequently reported during clinical trials of topiramate for adjunctive epilepsy.
0	For the adjunctive epilepsy population, the incidence of somnolence did not differ substantially between 200 mg per day and 1,000 mg per day, but the incidence of fatigue was dose-related and increased at dosages above 400 mg per day.
0	For the monotherapy epilepsy population in the 50 mg per day and 400 mg per day groups, the incidence of somnolence was dose-related (9% for the 50 mg per day group and 15% for the 400 mg per day group) and the incidence of fatigue was comparable in both treatment groups (14% each).
0	For the migraine population, somnolence and fatigue were dose-related and more common in the titration phase.
0	Additional nonspecific CNS events commonly observed with topiramate in the adjunctive epilepsy population include dizziness or ataxia.
0	Pediatric Patients Epilepsy In double-blind adjunctive therapy and monotherapy epilepsy clinical studies conducted with topiramate, the incidences of cognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse reactions in pediatric patients were generally lower than observed in adults.
0	These reactions included psychomotor slowing, difficulty with concentration/attention, speech disorders/related speech problems and language problems.
0	The most frequently reported neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric patients during adjunctive therapy double-blind studies were somnolence and fatigue.
0	The most frequently reported neuropsychiatric reactions in pediatric patients in the 50 mg per day and 400 mg per day groups during the monotherapy double-blind study were headache, dizziness, anorexia, and somnolence.
0	No patients discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions in the adjunctive epilepsy double-blind trials.
0	In the monotherapy epilepsy double-blind trial conducted with immediate-release topiramate product, 1 pediatric patient (2%) in the 50 mg per day group and 7 pediatric patients (12%) in the 400 mg per day group discontinued treatment due to any adverse reactions.
0	The most common adverse reaction associated with discontinuation of therapy was difficulty with concentration/attention; all occurred in the 400 mg per day group.
0	Migraine The incidence of cognitive adverse reactions was increased in topiramate-treated patients (7%) versus placebo (4%) in pooled, double-blind placebo-controlled studies in which adolescent patients (12 to 17 years) were randomized to placebo or one of several fixed daily doses of topiramate (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg).
0	The incidence of cognitive adverse reactions was also increased in a placebo-controlled study of pediatric patients (6 to 16 years) treated with 2 to 3 mg/kg/day of topiramate (10%) versus placebo treatment (2%).
0	QUDEXY XR is not approved for prophylaxis of migraine in pediatric patients under 12 years of age.
0	The risk for cognitive adverse reactions was dose-dependent, and was particularly evident at the 200 mg dose.
0	This risk for cognitive adverse reactions was also greater in younger patients (6 to 11 years) than in older patients (12 to 17 years).
0	The most common cognitive adverse reaction in these trials was difficulty with concentration/attention.
0	Cognitive adverse reactions most commonly developed in the titration period and sometimes persisted into the maintenance period.
0	These adverse reactions typically occurred in isolation as single type of cognitive adverse reaction.
0	Cognitive adverse reactions that led to study discontinuation occurred in one patient (difficulty with concentration/attention and language problems).
0	The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was administered to adolescents (12 to 17 years) to assess the effects of topiramate on cognitive function at baseline and at the end of the Study 3.
0	Mean change from baseline in certain CANTAB tests suggests that topiramate treatment may result in psychomotor slowing and decreased verbal fluency.
0	Topiramate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
0	Data from pregnancy registries indicate that infants exposed to topiramate in utero have an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) and for being small for gestational age.
0	In multiple species, oral administration of topiramate to pregnant animals at clinically relevant doses resulted in structural malformations, including craniofacial defects, and reduced body weights in offspring.
0	Consider the benefits and risks of QUDEXY XR when administering the drug in women of childbearing potential, particularly when QUDEXY XR is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death.
0	QUDEXY XR should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.
0	If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to a fetus.
0	In patients with or without a history of seizures or epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs including QUDEXY XR, should be gradually withdrawn to minimize the potential for seizures or increased seizure frequency.
0	In situations where rapid withdrawal of QUDEXY XR is medically required, appropriate monitoring is recommended.
0	Hyperammonemia/Encephalopathy Without Concomitant Valproic Acid (VPA) Topiramate treatment has produced hyperammonemia (in some instances dose-related) in a clinical investigational program in adolescent patients (12 to 17 years) who were treated with topiramate for migraine prophylaxis.
0	The incidence of hyperammonemia (above the upper limit of normal reference) at any time in the trial was 9% for placebo, 14% for 50 mg, and 26% for 100 mg topiramate daily.
0	In some patients, hyperammonemia was observed at the end of the trial at the final visit.
0	The incidence of markedly increased hyperammonemia (at least 50% or higher above upper limit of normal) at any time in the trial in adolescent patients was also increased at 100 mg/day (9%) compared to 50 mg topiramate (0%) or placebo (3%).
0	During this trial, markedly increased ammonia levels returned to normal in all but one patient (in whom the ammonia level fell to high instead of markedly abnormal).
0	Topiramate treatment has produced hyperammonemia in a clinical investigational program in very young pediatric patients (1 month to 24 months) who were treated with adjunctive topiramate for partial onset epilepsy (8% for placebo, 10% for 5 mg/kg/day, 0% for 15 mg/kg/day, 9% for 25 mg/kg/day).
0	QUDEXY XR is not approved as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in pediatric patients less than 2 years old.
0	In some patients, ammonia was markedly increased (greater than 50% above upper limit of normal).
0	The hyperammonemia associated with topiramate treatment occurred with and without encephalopathy in placebo-controlled trials, and in an open-label, extension trial of infants with refractory epilepsy.
0	Dose-related hyperammonemia was also observed in the extension trial in pediatric patients up to 2 years old.
0	Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting.
0	Hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy has also been observed in post-marketing reports in patients who were taking topiramate without concomitant valproic acid (VPA).
0	Hyperammonemia/Encephalopathy With Concomitant Valproic Acid (VPA) Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproic acid (VPA) has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone based upon post-marketing reports.
0	Although hyperammonemia may be asymptomatic, clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting.
0	In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug.
0	This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.
0	Although QUDEXY XR is not indicated for use in infants/toddlers (1 month to 24 months), topiramate with concomitant VPA clearly produced a dose-related increase in the incidence of hyperammonemia (above the upper limit of normal, 0% for placebo, 12% for 5 mg/kg/day, 7% for 15 mg/kg/day, 17% for 25 mg/kg/day) in an investigational program using topiramate.
0	Markedly increased, dose-related hyperammonemia (0% for placebo and 5 mg/kg/day, 7% for 15 mg/kg/day, and 8% for 25 mg/kg/day) also occurred in these infants/toddlers.
0	Dose-related hyperammonemia was similarly observed in a long-term, extension trial utilizing topiramate in these very young, pediatric patients.
0	Hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy has also been observed in post-marketing reports in patients taking topiramate with valproic acid (VPA).
0	The hyperammonemia associated with topiramate treatment appears to be more common when used concomitantly with VPA.
0	Monitoring for Hyperammonemia Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy.
0	Although not studied, topiramate or QUDEXY XR treatment or an interaction of concomitant topiramate-based product and valproic acid treatment may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.
0	In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status associated with any topiramate treatment, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.
0	A total of 32/2086 (1.5%) of adults exposed to topiramate during its adjunctive epilepsy therapy development reported the occurrence of kidney stones, an incidence about 2 to 4 times greater than expected in a similar, untreated population.
0	In the double-blind monotherapy epilepsy study, a total of 4/319 (1.3%) of adults exposed to topiramate reported the occurrence of kidney stones.
0	As in the general population, the incidence of stone formation among topiramate-treated patients was higher in men.
0	Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking topiramate for epilepsy or migraine.
0	During long-term (up to 1 year) topiramate treatment in an open-label extension study of 284 pediatric patients 1 month to 24 months old with epilepsy, 7% developed kidney or bladder stones that were diagnosed clinically or by sonogram.
0	QUDEXY XR is not approved for pediatric patients less than 2 years old.
0	Kidney stones have also been reported in pediatric patients taking topiramate for migraine prophylaxis.
0	For the double-blind migraine prophylaxis studies, one adverse event (renal calculus) occurred in a topiramate-treated subject in the age 12 to 17 years group.
0	The overall experience with open-label, long-term, topiramate treatment for migraine prophylaxis is limited in pediatric patients.
0	QUDEXY XR would be expected to have the same effect as topiramate on the formation of kidney stones.
0	An explanation for the association of topiramate and kidney stones may lay in the fact that topiramate is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.
0	Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) can promote stone formation by reducing urinary citrate excretion and by increasing urinary pH.
0	The concomitant use of QUDEXY XR with any other drug producing metabolic acidosis, or potentially in patients on a ketogenic diet, may create a physiological environment that increases the risk of kidney stone formation, and should therefore be avoided.
0	Increased fluid intake increases the urinary output, lowering the concentration of substances involved in stone formation.
0	Hydration is recommended to reduce new stone formation.
0	Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to less than 35<U+00BA>C (95<U+00BA>F) has been reported in association with topiramate use with concomitant valproic acid (VPA) both in the presence and in the absence of hyperammonemia.
0	This adverse reaction in patients using concomitant topiramate and valproate can occur after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate.
0	Consideration should be given to stopping topiramate or valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
0	Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.
0	Paresthesia (usually tingling of the extremities), an effect associated with the use of other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, appears to be a common effect of topiramate in adult and pediatric patients.
0	Paresthesia was more frequently reported in the monotherapy epilepsy trials and migraine prophylaxis trials conducted with immediate-release topiramate than in the adjunctive therapy epilepsy trials conducted with the same product.
0	In the majority of instances, paresthesia did not lead to treatment discontinuation.
0	Patients should be watched carefully when QUDEXY XR is co-administered with other CNS depressant drugs.
0	The precise mechanisms by which topiramate exerts its anticonvulsant and migraine prophylaxis effects are unknown; however, preclinical studies have revealed four properties that may contribute to topiramate's efficacy for epilepsy and migraine prophylaxis.
0	Electrophysiological and biochemical evidence suggests that topiramate, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels, augments the activity of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyrate at some subtypes of the GABA-A receptor, antagonizes the AMPA/kainate subtype of the glutamate receptor, and inhibits the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, particularly isozymes II and IV.
0	Topiramate has anticonvulsant activity in rat and mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) tests.
0	Topiramate is only weakly effective in blocking clonic seizures induced by the GABA-A receptor antagonist, pentylenetetrazole.
0	Topiramate is also effective in rodent models of epilepsy, which include tonic and absence-like seizures in the spontaneous epileptic rat (SER) and tonic and clonic seizures induced in rats by kindling of the amygdala or by global ischemia.
0	Changes (increases and decreases) from baseline in vital signs (systolic blood pressure-SBP, diastolic blood pressure-DBP, pulse) occurred more frequently in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) treated with various daily doses of topiramate (50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 2 to 3 mg/kg) than in patients treated with placebo in controlled trials for migraine prophylaxis.
0	The most notable changes were SBP < 90 mm Hg, DBP < 50 mm Hg, SBP or DBP increases or decreases <U+2265> 20 mm Hg, and pulse increases or decreases <U+2265> 30 beats per minute.
0	These changes were often dose-related, and were most frequently associated with the greatest treatment difference at the 200 mg dose level.
0	When a position was specified for measurement of vital signs in a trial, measurements were made in a sitting position.
0	Systematic collection of orthostatic vital signs has not been conducted.
0	The clinical significance of these various changes in vital signs has not been clearly established.
0	Absorption and Distribution The pharmacokinetics of QUDEXY XR are linear with dose proportional increases in plasma concentration when administered as a single oral dose over the range of 50 mg to 1,400 mg. At 25 mg, the pharmacokinetics of QUDEXY XR are nonlinear, possibly due to the binding of topiramate to carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells.
0	QUDEXY XR sprinkled on a spoonful of soft food is bioequivalent to the intact capsule formulation.
0	Following a single 200 mg oral dose of QUDEXY XR, peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) occurred approximately 20 hours after dosing.
0	Steady-state was reached in about 5 days following daily dosing of QUDEXY XR in subjects with normal renal function, with a Tmax of approximately 6 hours.
0	At steady-state, the plasma exposure (AUC0-24hr, Cmax, and Cmin) of topiramate from QUDEXY XR administered once daily and the immediate-release topiramate tablets administered twice-daily were shown to be bioequivalent.
0	Fluctuation of topiramate plasma concentrations at steady-state for QUDEXY XR administered once daily was approximately 40% in healthy subjects, compared to approximately 53% for immediate-release topiramate.
1	Compared to the fasted state, high-fat meal had no effect on bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) but delayed the Tmax by approximately 4 hours following a single dose of QUDEXY XR.
0	Topiramate is 15% to 41% bound to human plasma proteins over the blood concentration range of 0.5 mcg/mL to 250 mcg/mL.
0	The fraction bound decreased as blood concentration increased.
0	Carbamazepine and phenytoin do not alter the binding of immediate-release topiramate.
0	Sodium valproate, at 500 mcg/mL (a concentration 5 to 10 times higher than considered therapeutic for valproate) decreased the protein binding of immediate-release topiramate from 23% to 13%.
0	Immediate-release topiramate does not influence the binding of sodium valproate.
0	Metabolism and Excretion Topiramate is not extensively metabolized and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine (approximately 70% of an administered dose).
0	Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose.
0	The metabolites are formed via hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation.
0	There is evidence of renal tubular reabsorption of topiramate.
0	In rats, given probenecid to inhibit tubular reabsorption, along with topiramate, a significant increase in renal clearance of topiramate was observed.
0	This interaction has not been evaluated in humans.
0	Overall, oral plasma clearance (CL/F) is approximately 20 mL/min to 30 mL/min in adults following oral administration.
0	The mean effective half-life of QUDEXY XR is approximately 56 hours.
0	Steady-state is reached in about 5 days after QUDEXY XR dosing in subjects with normal renal function.
0	Specific Populations Renal Impairment The clearance of topiramate was reduced by 42% in subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 69 mL/min/1.73 m2) and by 54% in subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared to subjects with normal renal function (creatinine clearance greater than70 mL/min/1.73 m2).
0	Since topiramate is presumed to undergo significant tubular reabsorption, it is uncertain whether this experience can be generalized to all situations of renal impairment.
0	It is conceivable that some forms of renal disease could differentially affect glomerular filtration rate and tubular reabsorption resulting in a clearance of topiramate not predicted by creatinine clearance.
0	In general, however, use of one-half the usual starting and maintenance dose is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m2.
0	Hemodialysis Topiramate is cleared by hemodialysis.
0	Using a high-efficiency, counterflow, single pass-dialysate hemodialysis procedure, topiramate dialysis clearance was 120 mL/min with blood flow through the dialyzer at 400 mL/min.
0	This high clearance (compared to 20 mL/min to 30 mL/min total oral clearance in healthy adults) will remove a clinically significant amount of topiramate from the patient over the hemodialysis treatment period.
0	Therefore, a supplemental dose may be required.
0	Hepatic Impairment In subjects with hepatic impairment, the clearance of topiramate may be decreased; the mechanism underlying the decrease is not well understood.
0	Age, Gender and Race The pharmacokinetics of topiramate in elderly subjects (65 to 85 years of age, N=16) were evaluated in a controlled clinical study.
0	The elderly subject population had reduced renal function (creatinine clearance [-20%]) compared to young adults.
0	Following a single oral 100 mg dose, maximum plasma concentration for elderly and young adults was achieved at approximately 1 to 2 hours.
0	Reflecting the primary renal elimination of topiramate, topiramate plasma and renal clearance were reduced 21% and 19%, respectively, in elderly subjects, compared to young adults.
0	Similarly, topiramate half-life was longer (13%) in the elderly.
0	Reduced topiramate clearance resulted in slightly higher maximum plasma concentration (23%) and AUC (25%) in elderly subjects than observed in young adults.
0	Topiramate clearance is decreased in the elderly only to the extent that renal function is reduced.
0	Because of this, dosage adjustment may be necessary.
0	Clearance of topiramate in adults was not affected by gender or race.
0	Pediatric Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics of immediate-release topiramate were evaluated in patients ages 2 years to less than 16 years.
0	Patients received either no or a combination of other antiepileptic drugs.
0	A population pharmacokinetic model was developed on the basis of pharmacokinetic data from relevant topiramate clinical studies.
0	This dataset contained data from 1217 subjects including 258 pediatric patients aged 2 years to less than 16 years (95 pediatric patients less than 10 years of age).
1	Pediatric patients on adjunctive treatment exhibited a higher oral clearance (L/h) of topiramate compared to patients on monotherapy, presumably because of increased clearance from concomitant enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs.
0	In comparison, topiramate clearance per kg is greater in pediatric patients than in adults and in young pediatric patients (down to 2 years) than in older pediatric patients.
0	Consequently, the plasma drug concentration for the same mg/kg/day dose would be lower in pediatric patients compared to adults and also in younger pediatric patients compared to older pediatric patients.
1	As in adults, hepatic enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs decrease the steady state plasma concentrations of topiramate.
0	Drug-Drug Interaction Studies Antiepileptic Drugs Potential interactions between immediate-release topiramate and standard AEDs were assessed in controlled clinical pharmacokinetic studies in patients with epilepsy.
0	The effects of these interactions on mean plasma AUCs are summarized in Table 14.
0	Interaction of QUDEXY XR and standard AEDs is not expected to differ from the experience with immediate-release topiramate products.
0	In Table 14, the second column (AED concentration) describes what happened to the concentration of the AED listed in the first column when topiramate was added.
0	The third column (topiramate concentration) describes how the co-administration of a drug listed in the first column modified the concentration of topiramate in experimental settings when topiramate was given alone.
0	Table 14: Summary of AED Interactions with topiramate AED Co-administered AED Concentration Topiramate Concentration NC=Less than 10% change in plasma concentrationAED=Antiepileptic drugNE=Not evaluatedTPM=topiramate Phenytoin NC or 25% increasePlasma concentration increased 25% in some patients, generally those on a twice a day dosing regimen of phenytoin 48% decrease Carbamazepine (CBZ) NC 40% decrease CBZ epoxideIs not administered, but is an active metabolite of carbamazepine NC NE Valproic acid 11% decrease 14% decrease Phenobarbital NC NE Primidone NC NE Lamotrigine NC at TPM doses up to 400 mg per day 13% decrease In addition to the pharmacokinetic interaction described in the above table, concomitant administration of valproic acid and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy and hypothermia.
0	CNS Depressants or Alcohol Concomitant administration of topiramate and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies.
0	Oral Contraceptives In a pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers with a concomitantly administered combination oral contraceptive product containing 1 mg norethindrone (NET) plus 35 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE), topiramate, given in the absence of other medications at doses of 50 to 200 mg per day, was not associated with statistically significant changes in mean exposure (AUC) to either component of the oral contraceptive.
0	In another study, exposure to EE was statistically significantly decreased at doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg per day (18%, 21%, and 30%, respectively) when given as adjunctive therapy in patients taking valproic acid.
0	In both studies, topiramate (50 mg per day to 800 mg per day) did not significantly affect exposure to NET.
0	Although there was a dose-dependent decrease in EE exposure for doses between 200 to 800 mg per day, there was no significant dose-dependent change in EE exposure for doses of 50 to 200 mg per day.
0	The clinical significance of the changes observed is not known.
0	The possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding should be considered in patients taking combination oral contraceptive products with QUDEXY XR.
1	Digoxin In a single-dose study, serum digoxin AUC was decreased by 12% with concomitant topiramate administration.
0	The clinical relevance of this observation has not been established.
0	Hydrochlorothiazide A drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (25 mg every 24 hours) and topiramate (96 mg every 12 hours) when administered alone and concomitantly.
1	The results of this study indicate that topiramate Cmax increased by 27% and AUC increased by 29% when HCTZ was added to topiramate.
0	The clinical significance of this change is unknown.
0	The addition of HCTZ to QUDEXY XR therapy may require an adjustment of the QUDEXY XR dose.
0	The steady-state pharmacokinetics of HCTZ were not significantly influenced by the concomitant administration of topiramate.
0	Clinical laboratory results indicated decreases in serum potassium after topiramate or HCTZ administration, which were greater when HCTZ and topiramate were administered in combination.
0	Metformin Topiramate treatment can frequently cause metabolic acidosis, a condition for which the use of metformin is contraindicated.
0	QUDEXY XR is expected to exhibit the same degree of metabolic acidosis as topiramate.
0	A drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of metformin (500 mg every 12 hr) and topiramate in plasma when metformin was given alone and when metformin and topiramate (100 mg every 12 hr) were given simultaneously.
1	The results of this study indicated that the mean metformin Cmax and AUC0-12h increased by 18% and 25%, respectively, when topiramate was added.
0	Topiramate did not affect metformin Tmax.
0	The clinical significance of the effect of topiramate on metformin pharmacokinetics is not known.
0	Oral plasma clearance of topiramate appears to be reduced when administered with metformin.
0	The clinical significance of the effect of metformin on topiramate QUDEXY XR pharmacokinetics is unclear.
0	Pioglitazone A drug-drug interaction study conducted in healthy volunteers evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of topiramate and pioglitazone when administered alone and concomitantly.
1	A 15% decrease in the AUC<U+03C4>,ss of pioglitazone with no alteration in Cmax,ss was observed.
0	This finding was not statistically significant.
1	In addition, a 13% and 16% decrease in Cmax,ss and AUC<U+03C4>,ss respectively, of the active hydroxy-metabolite was noted as well as a 60% decrease in Cmax,ss and AUC<U+03C4>,ss of the active keto-metabolite.
0	The clinical significance of these findings is not known.
0	When QUDEXY XR is added to pioglitazone therapy or pioglitazone is added to QUDEXY XR therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state.
0	Glyburide A drug-drug interaction study conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes evaluated the steady-state pharmacokinetics of glyburide (5 mg per day) alone and concomitantly with topiramate (150 mg per day).
1	There was a 22% decrease in Cmax and 25% reduction in AUC24 for glyburide during topiramate administration.
1	Systemic exposure (AUC) of the active metabolites, 4-trans-hydroxy glyburide (M1) and 3-cis-hydroxyglyburide (M2), was also reduced by 13% and 15%, reduced Cmax by 18% and 25%, respectively.
0	The steady-state pharmacokinetics of topiramate were unaffected by concomitant administration of glyburide.
1	Lithium In patients, the pharmacokinetics of lithium were unaffected during treatment with topiramate at doses of 200 mg per day; however, there was an observed increase in systemic exposure of lithium (27% for Cmax and 26% for AUC) following topiramate doses up to 600 mg per day.
0	Haloperidol The pharmacokinetics of a single dose of haloperidol (5 mg) were not affected following multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hr) in 13 healthy adults (6 males, 7 females).
1	Amitriptyline There was a 12% increase in AUC and Cmax for amitriptyline (25 mg per day) in 18 normal subjects (9 males, 9 females) receiving 200 mg per day of topiramate.
1	Some subjects may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of QUDEXY XR and any adjustments in amitriptyline dose should be made according to the patient's clinical response and not on the basis of plasma levels.
0	Sumatriptan Multiple dosing of topiramate (100 mg every 12 hrs) in 24 healthy volunteers (14 males, 10 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of single-dose sumatriptan either orally (100 mg) or subcutaneously (6 mg).
1	Risperidone When administered concomitantly with topiramate at escalating doses of 100, 250, and 400 mg per day, there was a reduction in risperidone systemic exposure (16% and 33% for steady-state AUC at the 250 and 400 mg per day doses of topiramate).
0	No alterations of 9-hydroxyrisperidone levels were observed.
1	Coadministration of topiramate 400 mg per day with risperidone resulted in a 14% increase in Cmax and a 12% increase in AUC12 of topiramate.
0	There were no clinically significant changes in the systemic exposure of risperidone plus 9- hydroxyrisperidone or of topiramate; therefore, this interaction is not likely to be of clinical significance.
0	Propranolol Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg per day) in 34 healthy volunteers (17 males, 17 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of propranolol following daily 160 mg doses.
0	Propranolol doses of 160 mg per day in 39 volunteers (27 males, 12 females) had no effect on the exposure to topiramate at a dose of 200 mg per day of topiramate.
0	Dihydroergotamine Multiple dosing of topiramate (200 mg per day) in 24 healthy volunteers (12 males, 12 females) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of a 1 mg subcutaneous dose of dihydroergotamine.
0	Similarly, a 1 mg subcutaneous dose of dihydroergotamine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of a 200 mg per day dose of topiramate in the same study.
1	Diltiazem Co-administration of diltiazem (240 mg) with topiramate (150 mg per day) resulted in a 10% decrease in Cmax and 25% decrease in diltiazem AUC, 27% decrease in Cmax and 18% decrease in des-acetyl diltiazem AUC, and no effect on N-desmethyl diltiazem.
1	Co-administration of topiramate with diltiazem resulted in a 16% increase in Cmax and a 19% increase in AUC12 of topiramate.
0	Venlafaxine Multiple dosing of topiramate (150 mg per day) in healthy volunteers did not affect the pharmacokinetics of venlafaxine or O-desmethyl venlafaxine.
0	Multiple dosing of venlafaxine (150 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of topiramate.
0	Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Concomitant use of QUDEXY XR, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., zonisamide, acetazolamide, or dichlorphenamide), may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis and may also increase the risk of kidney stone formation.
0	Therefore, if QUDEXY XR is given concomitantly with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, the patient should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis.
0	QUDEXY XR, taken once daily, provides similar steady-state topiramate concentrations to immediate-release topiramate taken every 12 hours, when administered at the same total daily dose.
0	In a healthy volunteer, multiple-dose crossover study, the 90% CI for the ratios of AUC0-24, Cmax and Cmin, as well as partial AUC (the area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to time p (post dose)) for multiple time points were within the 80 to 125% bioequivalence limits, indicating no clinically significant difference between the two formulations.
0	In addition, the 90% CI for the ratios of topiramate plasma concentration at each of multiple time points over 24 hours for the two formulations were within the 80 to 125% bioequivalence limits, except for the initial time points before 3 hours and at 8 hours post-dose, which is not expected to have a significant clinical impact.
0	The effects of switching between QUDEXY XR and immediate-release topiramate were also evaluated in the same multiple-dose, crossover, comparative bioavailability study.
0	In healthy subjects switched from immediate-release topiramate given every 12 hours to QUDEXY XR given once daily, similar concentrations were maintained immediately after the formulation switch.
0	On the first day following the switch, there were no significant differences in AUC0-24, Cmax, and Cmin, as the 90% CI for the ratios were contained within the 80% to 125% equivalence limits.

0	A reversible increase in the number of normal surface gastric epithelial cells occurred in the dog, rat, and mouse.
0	No such increase has been observed in humans administered Cytotec for up to 1 year.
0	An apparent response of the female mouse to Cytotec in long-term studies at 100 to 1000 times the human dose was hyperostosis, mainly of the medulla of sternebrae.
0	Hyperostosis did not occur in long-term studies in the dog and rat and has not been seen in humans treated with Cytotec.
0	There was no evidence of an effect of Cytotec on tumor occurrence or incidence in rats receiving daily doses up to 150 times the human dose for 24 months.
0	Similarly, there was no effect of Cytotec on tumor occurrence or incidence in mice receiving daily doses up to 1000 times the human dose for 21 months.
0	The mutagenic potential of Cytotec was tested in several in vitro assays, all of which were negative.
0	Misoprostol, when administered to breeding male and female rats at doses 6.25 times to 625 times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose, produced dose-related pre- and post-implantation losses and a significant decrease in the number of live pups born at the highest dose.
0	These findings suggest the possibility of a general adverse effect on fertility in males and females.

0	Cytotec can induce or augment uterine contractions.
0	Vaginal administration of Cytotec, outside of its approved indication, has been used as a cervical ripening agent, for the induction of labor and for treatment of serious postpartum hemorrhage in the presence of uterine atony.
0	A major adverse effect of the obstetrical use of Cytotec is uterine tachysystole which may progress to uterine tetany with marked impairment of uteroplacental blood flow, uterine rupture (requiring surgical repair, hysterectomy, and/or salpingo-oophorectomy), or amniotic fluid embolism and lead to adverse fetal heart changes.
0	Uterine activity and fetal status should be monitored by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting.
0	The risk of uterine rupture associated with misoprostol use in pregnancy increases with advancing gestational ages and prior uterine surgery, including Cesarean delivery.
0	Grand multiparity also appears to be a risk factor for uterine rupture.
0	The use of Cytotec outside of its approved indication may also be associated with meconium passage, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, and Cesarean delivery.
0	Maternal shock, maternal death, fetal bradycardia, and fetal death have also been reported with the use of misoprostol.
0	Cytotec should not be used in the third trimester in women with a history of Cesarean section or major uterine surgery because of an increased risk of uterine rupture.
0	Cytotec should not be used in cases where uterotonic drugs are generally contraindicated or where hyperstimulation of the uterus is considered inappropriate, such as cephalopelvic disproportion, grand multiparity, hypertonic or hyperactive uterine patterns, or fetal distress where delivery is not imminent, or when surgical intervention is more appropriate.
0	The effect of Cytotec on later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child when Cytotec is used for cervical ripening or induction of labor has not been established.
0	Information on Cytotec's effect on the need for forceps delivery or other intervention is unknown.
0	The use of Cytotec (misoprostol) for the management of postpartum hemorrhage has been associated with reports of high fevers (greater than 40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit), accompanied by autonomic and central nervous system effects, such as tachycardia, disorientation, agitation, and convulsions.
0	Supportive therapy should be dictated by the patient's clinical presentation.
0	Misoprostol is rapidly metabolized in the mother to misoprostol acid, which is biologically active and is excreted in breast milk.
0	There are no published reports of adverse effects of misoprostol in breast-feeding infants of mothers taking misoprostol.
0	Caution should be exercised when misoprostol is administered to a nursing woman.
0	Safety and effectiveness of Cytotec in pediatric patients have not been established.
0	For hospital use only if misoprostol were to be used for cervical ripening, induction of labor, or for the treatment of serious post-partum hemorrhage, which are outside of the approved indication.
0	Misoprostol is extensively absorbed, and undergoes rapid de-esterification to its free acid, which is responsible for its clinical activity and, unlike the parent compound, is detectable in plasma.
0	The alpha side chain undergoes beta oxidation and the beta side chain undergoes omega oxidation followed by reduction of the ketone to give prostaglandin F analogs.
0	In normal volunteers, Cytotec (misoprostol) is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a Tmax of misoprostol acid of 12 <U+00B1> 3 minutes and a terminal half-life of 20<U+2013>40 minutes.
0	There is high variability of plasma levels of misoprostol acid between and within studies but mean values after single doses show a linear relationship with dose over the range of 200<U+2013>400 mcg.
0	No accumulation of misoprostol acid was noted in multiple dose studies; plasma steady state was achieved within two days.
1	Maximum plasma concentrations of misoprostol acid are diminished when the dose is taken with food and total availability of misoprostol acid is reduced by use of concomitant antacid.
0	Clinical trials were conducted with concomitant antacid, however, so this effect does not appear to be clinically important.

0	Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment showed an approximate doubling of T1/2, Cmax, and AUC compared to normals, but no clear correlation between the degree of impairment and AUC.
0	In subjects over 64 years of age, the AUC for misoprostol acid is increased.
0	No routine dosage adjustment is recommended in older patients or patients with renal impairment, but dosage may need to be reduced if the usual dose is not tolerated.
1	Drug interaction studies between misoprostol and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs showed no effect on the kinetics of ibuprofen or diclofenac, and a 20% decrease in aspirin AUC, not thought to be clinically significant.
0	Pharmacokinetic studies also showed a lack of drug interaction with antipyrine and propranolol when these drugs were given with misoprostol.
0	Misoprostol given for 1 week had no effect on the steady state pharmacokinetics of diazepam when the two drugs were administered 2 hours apart.
0	The serum protein binding of misoprostol acid is less than 90% and is concentration-independent in the therapeutic range.
0	After a single oral dose of misoprostol to nursing mothers, misoprostol acid was excreted in breast milk.
0	The maximum concentration of misoprostol acid in expressed breast milk was achieved within 1 hour after dosing and was 7.6 pg/ml (CV 37%) and 20.9 pg/ml (CV 62%) after single 200 <U+00B5>g and 600 <U+00B5>g misoprostol administration, respectively.
0	The misoprostol acid concentrations in breast milk declined to < 1 pg/ml at 5 hours post-dose.
0	Misoprostol has both antisecretory (inhibiting gastric acid secretion) and (in animals) mucosal protective properties.
0	NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and a deficiency of prostaglandins within the gastric mucosa may lead to diminishing bicarbonate and mucus secretion and may contribute to the mucosal damage caused by these agents.
0	Misoprostol can increase bicarbonate and mucus production, but in man this has been shown at doses 200 mcg and above that are also antisecretory.
0	It is therefore not possible to tell whether the ability of misoprostol to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer is the result of its antisecretory effect, its mucosal protective effect, or both.
0	In vitro studies on canine parietal cells using tritiated misoprostol acid as the ligand have led to the identification and characterization of specific prostaglandin receptors.
0	Receptor binding is saturable, reversible, and stereospecific.
0	The sites have a high affinity for misoprostol, for its acid metabolite, and for other E type prostaglandins, but not for F or I prostaglandins and other unrelated compounds, such as histamine or cimetidine.
0	Receptor-site affinity for misoprostol correlates well with an indirect index of antisecretory activity.
0	It is likely that these specific receptors allow misoprostol taken with food to be effective topically, despite the lower serum concentrations attained.
0	Misoprostol produces a moderate decrease in pepsin concentration during basal conditions, but not during histamine stimulation.
0	It has no significant effect on fasting or postprandial gastrin nor on intrinsic factor output.
0	Misoprostol, over the range of 50<U+2013>200 mcg, inhibits basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion, and acid secretion in response to a variety of stimuli, including meals, histamine, pentagastrin, and coffee.
0	Activity is apparent 30 minutes after oral administration and persists for at least 3 hours.
0	In general, the effects of 50 mcg were modest and shorter lived, and only the 200-mcg dose had substantial effects on nocturnal secretion or on histamine and meal-stimulated secretion.
0	Cytotec has been shown to produce uterine contractions that may endanger pregnancy.
0	Cytotec does not produce clinically significant effects on serum levels of prolactin, gonadotropins, thyroid-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, thyroxine, cortisol, gastrointestinal hormones (somatostatin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and motilin), creatinine, or uric acid.
0	Gastric emptying, immunologic competence, platelet aggregation, pulmonary function, or the cardiovascular system are not modified by recommended doses of Cytotec.
0	In a series of small short-term (about 1 week) placebo-controlled studies in healthy human volunteers, doses of misoprostol were evaluated for their ability to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced mucosal injury.
0	Studies of 200 mcg q.i.d. of misoprostol with tolmetin and naproxen, and of 100 and 200 mcg q.i.d. with ibuprofen, all showed reduction of the rate of significant endoscopic injury from about 70<U+2013>75% on placebo to 10<U+2013>30% on misoprostol.
0	Doses of 25<U+2013>200 mcg q.i.d. reduced aspirin-induced mucosal injury and bleeding.
0	Two 12-week, randomized, double-blind trials in osteoarthritic patients who had gastrointestinal symptoms but no ulcer on endoscopy while taking an NSAID compared the ability of 200 mcg of Cytotec, 100 mcg of Cytotec, and placebo to reduce the risk of gastric ulcer (GU) formation.
0	Patients were approximately equally divided between ibuprofen, piroxicam, and naproxen, and continued this treatment throughout the 12 weeks.
0	The 200-mcg dose caused a marked, statistically significant reduction in gastric ulcers in both studies.
0	The lower dose was somewhat less effective, with a significant result in only one of the studies.

0	No effect of Cytotec in reducing the risk of duodenal ulcers was demonstrated, but relatively few duodenal lesions were seen.
0	In another clinical trial, 239 patients receiving aspirin 650<U+2013>1300 mg q.i.d. for rheumatoid arthritis who had endoscopic evidence of duodenal and/or gastric inflammation were randomized to misoprostol 200 mcg q.i.d. or placebo for 8 weeks while continuing to receive aspirin.
0	The study evaluated the possible interference of Cytotec on the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis by analyzing joint tenderness, joint swelling, physician's clinical assessment, patient's assessment, change in ARA classification, change in handgrip strength, change in duration of morning stiffness, patient's assessment of pain at rest, movement, interference with daily activity, and ESR.
0	Cytotec did not interfere with the efficacy of aspirin in these patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
0	ACCOLATE is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to zafirlukast or any of its inactive ingredients.
1	Because food can reduce the bioavailability of zafirlukast, ACCOLATE should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.
0	The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in adults and children 12 years and older is 20 mg twice daily.
0	The recommended dose of ACCOLATE in children 5 through 11 years of age is 10 mg twice daily.
0	Elderly Patients: Based on cross-study comparisons, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in elderly patients (65 years of age and older), such that Cmax and AUC are approximately twice those of younger adults.
0	In clinical trials, a dose of 20 mg twice daily was not associated with an increase in the overall incidence of adverse events or withdrawals because of adverse events in elderly patients.
0	Patients with Hepatic Impairment: The clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients with stable alcoholic cirrhosis such that the Cmax and AUC are approximately 50 - 60% greater than those of normal adults.
0	ACCOLATE has not been evaluated in patients with hepatitis or in long-term studies of patients with cirrhosis.
0	Patients with Renal Impairment: Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment.
1	In a drug interaction study in 16 healthy male volunteers, coadministration of multiple doses of zafirlukast (160 mg/day) to steady-state with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin resulted in a significant increase in the mean AUC (+ 63%) and half-life (+36%) of S-warfarin.
0	The mean prothrombin time (PT) increased by approximately 35%.
0	This interaction is probably due to an inhibition by zafirlukast of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system.
0	Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy and ACCOLATE should have their prothrombin times monitored closely and anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly.
0	No formal drug-drug interaction studies with ACCOLATE and other drugs known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme (eg, tolbutamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine) have been conducted; however, care should be exercised when ACCOLATE is coadministered with these drugs.
1	In a drug interaction study in 11 asthmatic patients, coadministration of a single dose of zafirlukast (40 mg) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 5 days) to steady-state resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 40% due to a decrease in zafirlukast bioavailability.
0	Coadministration of zafirlukast (20 mg/day) or placebo at steady-state with a single dose of sustained release theophylline preparation (16 mg/kg) in 16 healthy boys and girls (6 through 11 years of age) resulted in no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline.
1	Coadministration of zafirlukast (80 mg/day) at steady-state with a single dose of a liquid theophylline preparation (6 mg/kg) in 13 asthmatic patients, 18 to 44 years of age, resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 30%, but no effect on plasma theophylline levels was observed.
1	Rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of ACCOLATE to an existing theophylline regimen have been reported.
0	The mechanism of the interaction between ACCOLATE and theophylline in these patients is unknown.
1	Coadministration of zafirlukast (40 mg/day) with aspirin (650 mg four times daily) resulted in mean increased plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 45%.
0	In a single-blind, parallel-group, 3-week study in 39 healthy female subjects taking oral contraceptives, 40 mg twice daily of zafirlukast had no significant effect on ethinyl estradiol plasma concentrations or contraceptive efficacy.
0	No formal drug-drug interaction studies between ACCOLATE and marketed drugs known to be metabolized by the P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme (eg, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, cyclosporin, cisapride) have been conducted.
0	As ACCOLATE is known to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro, it is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when these drugs are coadministered with ACCOLATE.
0	Patients should be told that a rare side effect of ACCOLATE is hepatic dysfunction, and to contact their physician immediately if they experience symptoms of hepatic dysfunction (eg. right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia).
0	Liver failure resulting in liver transplantation and death has occurred in patients taking zafirlukast.
0	ACCOLATE is indicated for the chronic treatment of asthma and should be taken regularly as prescribed, even during symptom-free periods.
0	ACCOLATE is not a bronchodilator and should not be used to treat acute episodes of asthma.
0	Patients receiving ACCOLATE should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other antiasthma medications unless instructed by a physician.
0	Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using ACCOLATE.
0	Women who are breast-feeding should be instructed not to take ACCOLATE.
0	Alternative antiasthma medication should be considered in such patients.
1	The bioavailability of ACCOLATE may be decreased when taken with food.
0	Patients should be instructed to take ACCOLATE at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.
0	In rare cases, patients on ACCOLATE therapy may present with systemic eosinophilia, eosinophilic pneumonia, or clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic steroid therapy.
0	These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction of oral steroid therapy.
0	Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients.
0	A causal association between ACCOLATE and these underlying conditions has not been established.
0	Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult, adolescent and pediatric patients taking ACCOLATE.
0	Post-marketing reports with ACCOLATE include insomnia and depression.
0	The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving ACCOLATE appear consistent with a drug-induced effect.
0	Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events.
0	Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur.

0	In two-year carcinogenicity studies, zafirlukast was administered at dietary doses of 10, 100, and 300 mg/kg to mice and 40, 400, and 2000 mg/kg to rats.
0	Male mice at an oral dose of 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 30 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m2 basis) showed an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas; female mice at this dose showed a greater incidence of whole body histocytic sarcomas.
0	Male and female rats at an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 160 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma area-under the curve [AUC] values) of zafirlukast showed an increased incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papillomas.
0	Zafirlukast was not tumorigenic at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg (approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children on a mg/m2 basis) in mice and at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg (resulting in approximately 140 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults and in children based on a comparison of the plasma AUC values) in rats.
0	The clinical significance of these findings for the long-term use of ACCOLATE is unknown.
0	Zafirlukast showed no evidence of mutagenic potential in the reverse microbial assay, in 2 forward point mutation (CHO-HGPRT and mouse lymphoma) assays or in two assays for chromosomal aberrations (the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenic assay and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay).
0	No evidence of impairment of fertility and reproduction was seen in male and female rats treated with zafirlukast at oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg (approximately 410 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis).
0	No teratogenicity was observed at oral doses up to 1600 mg/kg/day in mice (approximately 160 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis), up to 2000 mg/kg/day in rats (approximately 410 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults on a mg/m2 basis) and up to 2000 mg/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys (which resulted in approximately 20 times the exposure to drug plus metabolites compared to that from the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults based on comparison of the AUC values).
0	At an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day in rats, maternal toxicity and deaths were seen with increased incidence of early fetal resorption.
0	Spontaneous abortions occurred in cynomolgus monkeys at the maternally toxic oral dose of 2000 mg/kg/day.
0	There are no adequate and well-controlled trials in pregnant women.
0	Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, ACCOLATE should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
0	Following repeated 40 mg twice-a-day dosing in healthy women, average steady-state concentrations of zafirlukast in breast milk were 50 ng/mL compared to 255 ng/mL in plasma.
0	Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for zafirlukast in mouse and rat studies and the enhanced sensitivity of neonatal rats and dogs to the adverse effects of zafirlukast, ACCOLATE should not be administered to mothers who are breast-feeding.
0	The safety of ACCOLATE at doses of 10 mg twice daily has been demonstrated in 205 pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age in placebo-controlled trials lasting up to six weeks and with 179 patients in this age range participating in 52 weeks of treatment in an open label extension.
0	The effectiveness of ACCOLATE for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in pediatric patients 5 through 11 years of age is based on an extrapolation of the demonstrated efficacy of ACCOLATE in adults with asthma and the likelihood that the disease course, and pathophysiology and the drug<U+2019>s effect are substantially similar between the two populations.
0	The recommended dose for the patients 5 through 11 years of age is based upon a cross-study comparison of the pharmacokinetics of zafirlukast in adults and pediatric subjects, and on the safety profile of zafirlukast in both adult and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended dose.
0	The safety and effectiveness of zafirlukast for pediatric patients less than 5 years of age has not been established.
0	The effect of ACCOLATE on growth in children has not been determined.
0	Based on cross-study comparison, the clearance of zafirlukast is reduced in patients 65 years of age and older such that Cmax and AUC are approximately 2- to 3-fold greater than those of younger patients.
0	A total of 8094 patients were exposed to zafirlukast in North American and European short-term placebo-controlled clinical trials.
0	Of these, 243 patients were elderly (age 65 years and older).
0	No overall difference in adverse events was seen in the elderly patients, except for an increase in the frequency of infections among zafirlukast-treated elderly patients compared to placebo-treated elderly patients (7.0% vs. 2.9%).
0	The infections were not severe, occurred mostly in the lower respiratory tract, and did not necessitate withdrawal of therapy.
0	An open-label, uncontrolled, 4-week trial of 3759 asthma patients compared the safety and efficacy of ACCOLATE 20 mg given twice daily in three patient age groups, adolescents (12-17 years), adults (18-65 years), and elderly (greater than 65 years).
0	A higher percentage of elderly patients (n=384) reported adverse events when compared to adults and adolescents.
0	These elderly patients showed less improvement in efficacy measures.
0	In the elderly patients, adverse events occurring in greater than 1% of the population included headache (4.7%), diarrhea and nausea (1.8%), and pharyngitis (1.3%).
0	The elderly reported the lowest percentage of infections of all three age groups in this study.
0	Cases of life-threatening hepatic failure have been reported in patients treated with ACCOLATE.
0	Cases of liver injury without other attributable cause have been reported from post-marketing adverse event surveillance of patients who have received the recommended dose of ACCOLATE (40 mg/day).
0	In most, but not all post-marketing reports, the patient<U+2019>s symptoms abated and the liver enzymes returned to normal or near normal after stopping ACCOLATE.
0	In rare cases, patients have either presented with fulminant hepatitis or progressed to hepatic failure, liver transplantation and death.
0	In extremely rare post-marketing cases, no clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction were reported to precede the latter observations.
0	Physicians may consider the value of liver function testing.
0	Periodic serum transaminase testing has not proven to prevent serious injury but it is generally believed that early detection of drug-induced hepatic injury along with immediate withdrawal of the suspect drug enhances the likelihood for recovery.
0	Patients should be advised to be alert for signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction (eg, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, and anorexia) and to contact their physician immediately if they occur.
0	Ongoing clinical assessment of patients should govern physician interventions, including diagnostic evaluations and treatment.
0	If liver dysfunction is suspected based upon clinical signs or symptoms (eg, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, flu-like symptoms, anorexia, and enlarged liver), ACCOLATE should be discontinued.

0	Upward dose titration is frequently required.
0	Dosage information for patients with specific tumors follows.
0	Dosage may be initiated at 50 mcg three times a day.
0	Beginning with this low dose may permit adaptation to adverse gastrointestinal effects for patients who will require higher doses.
0	IGF-I (somatomedin C) levels every 2 weeks can be used to guide titration.
0	Alternatively, multiple growth hormone levels at 0-8 hours after Sandostatin<U+00AE> (octreotide acetate) administration permit more rapid titration of dose.
0	The goal is to achieve growth hormone levels less than 5 ng/mL or IGF-I (somatomedin C) levels less than 1.9 unit/mL in males and less than 2.2 unit/mL in females.
0	The dose most commonly found to be effective is 100 mcg three times a day, but some patients require up to 500 mcg three times a day for maximum effectiveness.
0	Doses greater than 300 mcg/day seldom result in additional biochemical benefit, and if an increase in dose fails to provide additional benefit, the dose should be reduced.
0	IGF-I (somatomedin C) or growth hormone levels should be reevaluated at 6-month intervals.
0	Sandostatin should be withdrawn yearly for approximately 4 weeks from patients who have received irradiation to assess disease activity.

0	The suggested daily dosage of Sandostatin during the first 2 weeks of therapy ranges from 100-600 mcg/day in 2-4 divided doses (mean daily dosage is 300 mcg).
0	In the clinical studies, the median daily maintenance dosage was approximately 450 mcg, but clinical and biochemical benefits were obtained in some patients with as little as 50 mcg, while others required doses up to 1500 mcg/day.
0	However, experience with doses above 750 mcg/day is limited.
0	Daily dosages of 200-300 mcg in 2-4 divided doses are recommended during the initial 2 weeks of therapy (range: 150-750 mcg) to control symptoms of the disease.
0	On an individual basis, dosage may be adjusted to achieve a therapeutic response, but usually doses above 450 mcg/day are not required.
0	No known interference exists with clinical laboratory tests, including amine or peptide determinations.
0	Sandostatin has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs.
0	Concomitant administration of Sandostatin with cyclosporine may decrease blood levels of cyclosporine and result in transplant rejection.
0	Patients receiving insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or agents to control fluid and electrolyte balance, may require dose adjustments of these therapeutic agents.
1	Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the availability of bromocriptine.
1	Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs might decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of growth hormones.
0	Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution.
0	Sandostatin<U+00AE> (octreotide acetate) alters the balance between the counter-regulatory hormones, insulin, glucagon and growth hormone, which may result in hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
0	Sandostatin also suppresses secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone, which may result in hypothyroidism.
0	Cardiac conduction abnormalities have also occurred during treatment with Sandostatin.
0	However, the incidence of these adverse events during long-term therapy was determined vigorously only in acromegaly patients who, due to their underlying disease and/or the subsequent treatment they receive, are at an increased risk for the development of diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and cardiovascular disease.
0	Although the degree to which these abnormalities are related to Sandostatin therapy is not clear, new abnormalities of glycemic control, thyroid function and ECG developed during Sandostatin therapy as described below.
0	Risk of Pregnancy with Normalization of IGF-1 and GH Although acromegaly may lead to infertility, there are reports of pregnancy in acromegalic women.
0	In women with active acromegaly who have been unable to become pregnant, normalization of GH and IGF-1 may restore fertility.
0	Female patients of childbearing potential should be advised to use adequate contraception during treatment with octreotide.
0	The hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia which occurs during Sandostatin therapy is usually mild, but may result in overt diabetes mellitus or necessitate dose changes in insulin or other hypoglycemic agents.

0	Severe hyperglycemia, subsequent pneumonia, and death following initiation of Sandostatin therapy was reported in one patient with no history of hyperglycemia.
0	In patients with concomitant Type I diabetes mellitus, Sandostatin Injection and Sandostatin LAR<U+00AE> Depot (octreotide acetate for injectable suspension) are likely to affect glucose regulation, and insulin requirements may be reduced.
0	Symptomatic hypoglycemia, which may be severe, has been reported in these patients.
0	In non-diabetics and Type II diabetics with partially intact insulin reserves, Sandostatin Injection or Sandostatin LAR Depot administration may result in decreases in plasma insulin levels and hyperglycemia.
0	It is therefore recommended that glucose tolerance and antidiabetic treatment be periodically monitored during therapy with these drugs.
0	In acromegalic patients, 12% developed biochemical hypothyroidism only, 8% developed goiter, and 4% required initiation of thyroid replacement therapy while receiving Sandostatin.
0	Baseline and periodic assessment of thyroid function (TSH, total and/or free T4) is recommended during chronic therapy.
0	In acromegalics, bradycardia (< 50 bpm) developed in 25%; conduction abnormalities occurred in 10% and arrhythmias occurred in 9% of patients during Sandostatin therapy.
0	Other EKG changes observed included QT prolongation, axis shifts, early repolarization, low voltage, R/S transition, and early R wave progression.
0	These ECG changes are not uncommon in acromegalic patients.

1	Depressed vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling<U+2019>s tests have been observed in some patients receiving Sandostatin therapy, and monitoring of vitamin B12 levels is recommended during chronic Sandostatin therapy.
0	Careful instruction in sterile subcutaneous injection technique should be given to the patients and to other persons who may administer Sandostatin Injection.
0	Laboratory tests that may be helpful as biochemical markers in determining and following patient response depend on the specific tumor.
0	Based on diagnosis, measurement of the following substances may be useful in monitoring the progress of therapy: Acromegaly: Growth Hormone, IGF-I (somatomedin C) Responsiveness to Sandostatin may be evaluated by determining growth hormone levels at 1-4 hour intervals for 8-12 hours post dose.
0	Alternatively, a single measurement of IGF-I (somatomedin C) level may be made two weeks after drug initiation or dosage change.
0	Carcinoid: 5-HIAA (urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid), plasma serotonin, plasma Substance P VIPoma: VIP (plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide) Baseline and periodic total and/or free T4 measurements should be performed during chronic therapy.
0	Studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated no mutagenic potential of Sandostatin.
0	No carcinogenic potential was demonstrated in mice treated subcutaneously for 85-99 weeks at doses up to 2000 mcg/kg/day (8 x the human exposure based on body surface area).
0	In a 116-week subcutaneous study in rats, a 27% and 12% incidence of injection site sarcomas or squamous cell carcinomas was observed in males and females, respectively, at the highest dose level of 1250 mcg/kg/day (10 x the human exposure based on body surface area) compared to an incidence of 8%-10% in the vehicle-control groups.
0	The increased incidence of injection site tumors was most probably caused by irritation and the high sensitivity of the rat to repeated subcutaneous injections at the same site.
0	Rotating injection sites would prevent chronic irritation in humans.
0	There have been no reports of injection site tumors in patients treated with Sandostatin for up to 5 years.
0	There was also a 15% incidence of uterine adenocarcinomas in the 1250 mcg/kg/day females compared to 7% in the saline-control females and 0% in the vehicle-control females.
0	The presence of endometritis coupled with the absence of corpora lutea, the reduction in mammary fibroadenomas, and the presence of uterine dilatation suggest that the uterine tumors were associated with estrogen dominance in the aged female rats which does not occur in humans.
0	Sandostatin did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 1000 mcg/kg/day, which represents 7x the human exposure based on body surface area.
0	There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of octreotide use in pregnant women.
0	Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 16 times the highest recommended human dose based on body surface area and revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to octreotide.
0	However, because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
0	In postmarketing data, a limited number of exposed pregnancies have been reported in patients with acromegaly.
0	Most women were exposed to octreotide during the first trimester of pregnancy at doses ranging from 100-300 mcg/day of Sandostatin s.c. or 20-30 mg/month of Sandostatin LAR, however some women elected to continue octreotide therapy throughout pregnancy.
0	In cases with a known outcome, no congenital malformations were reported.

0	Steady-state concentrations was achieved after 3 injections of a 40 mg dose.
0	Mean BMI increased 0.1 kg/m2 in Sandostatin LAR Depot-treated subjects compared to 0.0 kg/m2 in saline control-treated subjects.
0	Diarrhea occurred in 11 of 30 (37%) patients treated with Sandostatin LAR Depot.
0	No unexpected adverse events were observed.
0	However, with Sandostatin LAR Depot 40 mg once a month, the incidence of new cholelithiasis in this pediatric population (33%) was higher than that seen in other adults indications such as acromegaly (22%) or malignant carcinoid syndrome (24%), where Sandostatin LAR Depot was 10 to 30 mg once a month.
0	Clinical studies of Sandostatin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
0	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
0	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

0	One patient developed ascending cholangitis during Sandostatin therapy and died.
0	Sandostatin<U+00AE> (octreotide acetate) exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin.
0	It is an even more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin.
0	Like somatostatin, it also suppresses LH response to GnRH, decreases splanchnic blood flow, and inhibits release of serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and pancreatic polypeptide.

0	Assess for signs and symptoms of bleeding.
0	In patients with renal impairment anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.
0	If during Lovenox therapy abnormal coagulation parameters or bleeding should occur, anti-Factor Xa levels may be used to monitor the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.
0	Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are not adequate for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of Lovenox.
0	Whenever possible, agents which may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of Lovenox therapy.
0	These agents include medications such as: anticoagulants, platelet inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid, salicylates, NSAIDs (including ketorolac tromethamine), dipyridamole, or sulfinpyrazone.
0	If coadministration is essential, conduct close clinical and laboratory monitoring.
0	Discontinue agents which may enhance hemorrhage risk prior to initiation of Lovenox or conduct close clinical and laboratory monitoring.
0	Increased Risk of Hemorrhage: Monitor for signs of bleeding.
0	Risk of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia with or without Thrombosis.
0	Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet count closely.
0	Interchangeability with other heparins: Do not exchange with heparin or other LMWHs.

0	Monitor more frequently and adjust dosage as needed.
0	Cases of epidural or spinal hemorrhage and subsequent hematomas have been reported with the use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture procedures, resulting in long-term or permanent paralysis.
0	The risk of these events is higher with the use of postoperative indwelling epidural catheters, with the concomitant use of additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs, with traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture, or in patients with a history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity.
0	To reduce the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concurrent use of Lovenox and epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or spinal puncture, consider the pharmacokinetic profile of Lovenox.
0	Placement or removal of an epidural catheter or lumbar puncture is best performed when the anticoagulant effect of Lovenox is low; however, the exact timing to reach a sufficiently low anticoagulant effect in each patient is not known.
0	Placement or removal of a catheter should be delayed for at least 12 hours after administration of lower doses (30 mg once or twice daily or 40 mg once daily) of Lovenox, and at least 24 hours after the administration of higher doses (0.75 mg/kg twice daily, 1 mg/kg twice daily, or 1.5 mg/kg once daily) of Lovenox.
0	Anti-Xa levels are still detectable at these time points, and these delays are not a guarantee that neuraxial hematoma will be avoided.
0	Patients receiving the 0.75 mg/kg twice-daily dose or the 1 mg/kg twice-daily dose should not receive the second Lovenox dose in the twice-daily regimen to allow a longer delay before catheter placement or removal.
0	Likewise, although a specific recommendation for timing of a subsequent Lovenox dose after catheter removal cannot be made, consider delaying this next dose for at least four hours, based on a benefit-risk assessment considering both the risk for thrombosis and the risk for bleeding in the context of the procedure and patient risk factors.
0	For patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/minute, additional considerations are necessary because elimination of Lovenox is more prolonged; consider doubling the timing of removal of a catheter, at least 24 hours for the lower prescribed dose of Lovenox (30 mg once daily) and at least 48 hours for the higher dose (1 mg/kg/day).
0	Should the physician decide to administer anticoagulation in the context of epidural or spinal anesthesia/analgesia or lumbar puncture, frequent monitoring must be exercised to detect any signs and symptoms of neurological impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction.
0	Instruct patients to report immediately if they experience any of the above signs or symptoms.
0	If signs or symptoms of spinal hematoma are suspected, initiate urgent diagnosis and treatment including consideration for spinal cord decompression even though such treatment may not prevent or reverse neurological sequelae.
0	Use Lovenox with extreme caution in conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage, such as bacterial endocarditis, congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery, or in patients treated concomitantly with platelet inhibitors.
0	Major hemorrhages including retroperitoneal and intracranial bleeding have been reported.
0	Bleeding can occur at any site during therapy with Lovenox.
0	An unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure should lead to a search for a bleeding site.
0	To minimize the risk of bleeding following the vascular instrumentation during the treatment of unstable angina, non<U+2013>Q-wave myocardial infarction and acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, adhere precisely to the intervals recommended between Lovenox doses.
0	It is important to achieve hemostasis at the puncture site after PCI.
0	In case a closure device is used, the sheath can be removed immediately.
0	If a manual compression method is used, sheath should be removed 6 hours after the last intravenous/subcutaneous Lovenox.
0	If the treatment with Lovenox is to be continued, the next scheduled dose should be given no sooner than 6 to 8 hours after sheath removal.
0	The site of the procedure should be observed for signs of bleeding or hematoma formation.
0	Lovenox should be used with care in patients with a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled arterial hypertension or a history of recent gastrointestinal ulceration, diabetic retinopathy, renal dysfunction and hemorrhage.
0	Lovenox may cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITTS).
0	HITTS may lead to organ infarction, limb ischemia, or death.
0	Monitor thrombocytopenia of any degree closely.
0	Use of Lovenox in patients with a history of immune-mediated HIT within the past 100 days or in the presence of circulating antibodies is contraindicated.
0	Circulating antibodies may persist for several years.
0	Only use Lovenox in patients with a history of HIT if more than 100 days have elapsed since the prior HIT episode and no circulating antibodies are present.
0	Because HIT may still occur in these circumstances, the decision to use Lovenox in such a case must be made only after a careful benefit-risk assessment and after non-heparin alternative treatments are considered.
0	Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of Lovenox.
0	Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 1.3% in patients given Lovenox, 1.2% in patients given heparin, and 0.7% in patients given placebo in clinical trials.
0	Platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3 occurred at a rate of 0.1% in patients given Lovenox, in 0.2% of patients given heparin, and 0.4% of patients given placebo in the same trials.
0	Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely.
0	If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3, Lovenox should be discontinued.
0	Lovenox cannot be used interchangeably (unit for unit) with heparin or other low molecular weight heparins as they differ in manufacturing process, molecular weight distribution, anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities, units, and dosage.
0	Each of these medicines has its own instructions for use.
0	Use of Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may result in valve thrombosis.
0	In a clinical study of pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves given Lovenox (1 mg/kg twice daily) to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, 2 of 8 women developed clots resulting in blockage of the valve and leading to maternal and fetal death.
0	No patients in the heparin/warfarin group (0 of 4 women) died.
0	There also have been isolated postmarketing reports of valve thrombosis in pregnant women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves while receiving Lovenox for thromboprophylaxis.
0	Women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be at higher risk for thromboembolism during pregnancy and, when pregnant, have a higher rate of fetal loss from stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and premature delivery.
0	Therefore, frequent monitoring of peak and trough anti-Factor Xa levels, and adjusting of dosage may be needed.
0	Lovenox multiple-dose vials are not approved for use in neonates or infants.
0	Serious and fatal adverse reactions including gasping syndrome can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs, including Lovenox multiple-dose vials.
0	The gasping syndrome is characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and gasping respirations.
0	The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known (Lovenox multiple-dose vials contain 15 mg of benzyl alcohol per mL).
0	Because benzyl alcohol may cross the placenta, if anticoagulation with Lovenox is needed during pregnancy, use the preservative-free formulations where possible.
0	Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin which has antithrombotic properties.
0	In humans, enoxaparin given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously is characterized by a higher ratio of anti-Factor Xa to anti-Factor IIa activity (mean <U+00B1>SD, 14.0<U+00B1>3.1) (based on areas under anti-Factor activity versus time curves) compared to the ratios observed for heparin (mean <U+00B1>SD, 1.22<U+00B1>0.13).

0	Steady state is achieved on the second day of treatment.
0	Enoxaparin pharmacokinetics appears to be linear over the recommended dosage ranges.

0	Based on enoxaparin sodium pharmacokinetics, this difference in steady state is expected and within the therapeutic range.
0	Although not studied clinically, the 150 mg/mL concentration of enoxaparin sodium is projected to result in anticoagulant activities similar to those of 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL concentrations at the same enoxaparin dose.
0	When a daily 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous injection of enoxaparin sodium was given to 25 healthy male and female subjects using a 100 mg/mL or a 200 mg/mL concentration the following pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained.

0	The source of the gender difference in these parameters has not been conclusively identified; however, body weight may be a contributing factor.
0	Geriatric Apparent clearance and Amax derived from anti-Factor Xa values following single and multiple subcutaneous dosing in geriatric subjects were close to those observed in young subjects.
0	Following once a day subcutaneous dosing of 40 mg enoxaparin, the Day 10 mean area under anti-Factor Xa activity versus time curve (AUC) was approximately 15% greater than the mean Day 1 AUC value.
0	Renal impairment A linear relationship between anti-Factor Xa plasma clearance and creatinine clearance at steady state has been observed, which indicates decreased clearance of enoxaparin sodium in patients with reduced renal function.
0	Anti-Factor Xa exposure represented by AUC, at steady state, is marginally increased in patients with creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min and patients with creatinine clearance 30 to <50 mL/min renal impairment after repeated subcutaneous 40 mg once-daily doses.

0	Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection, particularly when used concomitantly with other opioids or central nervous system depressants.
0	Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection or following a dose increase.
0	Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death.
0	Reserve concomitant prescribing of nalbuphine hydrochloride and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
0	Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.
0	Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with: Significant respiratory depression Acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment Known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus Hypersensitivity to nalbuphine or to any of the other ingredients in Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be administered as a supplement to general anesthesia only by persons specifically trained in the use of intravenous anesthetics and management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids.
0	Naloxone, resuscitative and intubation equipment and oxygen should be readily available.
0	Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse.
0	Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy and following dosage increases with Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection and adjust the dosage accordingly.
0	Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.
0	The usual recommended adult dose is 10 mg for a 70 kg individual administered subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously; this dose may be repeated every 3 to 6 hours as necessary.
0	Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the pain, physical status of the patient, and other medications which the patient may be receiving.
0	In nontolerant individuals, the recommended single maximum dose is 20 mg with a maximum total daily dose of 160 mg.
0	The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection as a supplement to balanced anesthesia requires larger doses than those recommended for analgesia.
0	Induction doses of nalbuphine hydrochloride range from 0.3 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg intravenously to be administered over a 10 to 15 minute period with maintenance doses of 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg in single intravenous administrations as required.
0	The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may be followed by respiratory depression which can be reversed with the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride.
0	Individually titrate Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions.
0	Continually reevaluate patients receiving nalbuphine hydrochloride to assess the maintenance of pain control and the relative incidence of adverse reactions, as well as monitoring for the development of addiction, abuse, or misuse.
0	Frequent communication is important among the prescriber, other members of the healthcare team, the patient, and the caregiver/family during periods of changing analgesic requirements, including initial titration.
0	If the level of pain increases after dosage stabilization, attempt to identify the source of increased pain before increasing the nalbuphine hydrochloride dosage.
0	If unacceptable opioid-related adverse reactions are observed, consider reducing the dosage.
0	Adjust the dosage to obtain an appropriate balance between management of pain and opioid-related adverse events.
0	When a patient who has been taking Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection regularly and may be physically dependent no longer requires therapy with Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection, taper the dose gradually, by 25% to 50% every 2 to 4 days, while monitoring carefully for signs and symptoms of withdrawal.
0	If the patient develops these signs or symptoms, raise the dose to the previous level and taper more slowly, either by increasing the interval between decreases, decreasing the amount of change in dose, or both.
0	Do not abruptly discontinue Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection in a physically-dependent patient.
0	Although Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection possesses opioid antagonist activity, there is evidence that in nondependent patients it will not antagonize an opioid analgesic administered just before, concurrently, or just after an injection of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection.
0	Therefore, due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of other opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants such as alcohol, other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.
0	Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
0	Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.
0	The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome.
0	If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment.
0	Discontinue Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.
0	MAOI (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid) interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma ).
0	The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.
0	If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.
0	Because nalbuphine is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be used with caution in patients with renal or liver dysfunction and administered in reduced amounts.
0	As with all potent analgesics, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be used with caution in patients with myocardial infarction who have nausea or vomiting.
0	As with all opioid analgesics, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be used with caution in patients about to undergo surgery of the biliary tract since it may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi.
0	During evaluation of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection in anesthesia, a higher incidence of bradycardia has been reported in patients who did not receive atropine pre-operatively.
0	Patients should be advised of the following information: Inform patients that opioids could cause a rare but potentially life-threatening condition resulting from concomitant administration of serotonergic drugs.
0	Warn patients of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome and to seek medical attention right away if symptoms develop.
0	Instruct patients to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take serotonergic medications.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is associated with sedation and may impair mental and physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is to be used as prescribed by a physician.
0	Dose or frequency should not be increased without first consulting with a physician since Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may cause psychological or physical dependence.
0	The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection with other opioids can cause signs and symptoms of withdrawal.
0	Abrupt discontinuation of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection after prolonged usage may cause signs and symptoms of withdrawal.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity/sensitivity of the test.
0	Consult the test manufacturer for specific details.
0	Long term carcinogenicity studies were performed in rats (24 months) and mice (19 months) by oral administration at doses up to 200 mg/kg (1180 mg/m2) and 200 mg/kg (600 mg/m2) per day, respectively.
0	There was no evidence of an increase in tumors in either species related to Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection administration.
0	The maximum recommend human dose (MRHD) in a day is 160 mg subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously, or approximately 100 mg/m2/day for a 60 kg subject.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection did not have mutagenic activity in the AMES test with four bacterial strains, in the Chinese Hamster Ovary HGPRT assays or in the Sister Chromatids Exchange Assay.
0	However, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection induced an increased frequency of mutation in the mouse lymphoma assay.
0	Clastogenic activity was not observed in the mouse micronucleus test of the cytogenicity bone marrow assay in rats.
0	A reproduction study was performed in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 56 mg/kg/day or 330 mg/m2/day.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection did not affect either male or female fertility rats.
0	Reproduction studies have been performed in rats by subcutaneous administration of nalbuphine up to 100 mg/kg/day, or 590 mg/m2/day which is approximately 6 times the MRHD, and in rabbits by intravenous administration of nalbuphine up to 32 mg/kg/day, or 378 mg/m2/day which is approximately 4 times the MRHD.
0	The results did not reveal evidence of developmental toxicity, including teratogenicity, or harm to the fetus.
0	There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
0	Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
0	Neonatal body weight and survival rates were reduced at birth and during lactation when nalbuphine was subcutaneously administered to female and male rats prior to mating and throughout gestation and lactation or to pregnant rats during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation at doses approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose.
0	Severe fetal bradycardia has been reported when nalbuphine hydrochloride is administered during labor.
0	Although there are no reports of fetal bradycardia earlier in pregnancy, it is possible that this may occur.
0	This drug should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed, if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus, and if appropriate measures such as fetal monitoring are taken to detect and manage any potential adverse effect on the fetus.
0	Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho-physiologic effects in neonates.
0	An opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, must be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for use in pregnant women during or immediately prior to labor, when other analgesic techniques are more appropriate.
0	Opioid analgesics, including Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection, can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength, duration, and frequency of uterine contractions.
0	However, this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation, which tends to shorten labor.
0	Monitor neonates exposed to opioid analgesics during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression.
0	Limited data suggest that Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is excreted in maternal milk but only in a small amount (less than 1% of the administered dose) and with a clinically insignificant effect.
0	Infants exposed to Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression.
0	Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid analgesic is stopped, or when breast-feeding is stopped.
0	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established.
0	Elderly patients (aged 65 years or older) may have increased sensitivity to Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection.
0	In general, use caution when selecting a dosage for an elderly patient, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
0	Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids, and has occurred after large initial doses were administered to patients who were not opioid-tolerant or when opioids were co-administered with other agents that depress respiration.
0	Titrate the dosage of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection slowly in geriatric patients.
0	Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended.
0	Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death.
0	Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status.
0	Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.
0	While serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression can occur at any time during the use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection, the risk is greatest during the initiation of therapy or following a dosage increase.
0	Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of initiating therapy with and following dosage increases of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection.
0	To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is essential.
0	Overestimating the Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection dosage when converting patients from another opioid product can result in a fatal overdose with the first dose.
0	Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol).
0	Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
0	Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioid analgesics alone.
0	Because of similar pharmacological properties, it is reasonable to expect similar risk with the concomitant use of other CNS depressant drugs with opioid analgesics.
0	If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant concomitantly with an opioid analgesic, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use.
0	In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response.
0	If an opioid analgesic is initiated in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid analgesic, and titrate based on clinical response.
0	Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.
0	Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is used with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants (including alcohol and illicit drugs).
0	Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant have been determined.
0	Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of additional CNS depressants including alcohol and illicit drugs.
0	The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection.
0	Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients.
0	Monitor such patients closely, particularly when initiating and titrating Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection and when Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration.
0	Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.
0	Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than 1 month of use.
0	Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure.
0	If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible.
0	If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids.
0	Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers.
0	Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency.
0	The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.
0	The possible respiratory depressant effects and the potential of potent analgesics to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure (resulting from vasodilation following CO2 retention) may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.
0	Furthermore, potent analgesics can produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.
0	Therefore, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be used in these circumstances only when essential, and then should be administered with extreme caution.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery.
0	Therefore, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be administered with caution to ambulatory patients who should be warned to avoid such hazards.
0	Maintain patient under observation until recovered from Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection effects that would affect driving or other potentially dangerous tasks.
0	Severe fetal bradycardia has been reported when Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is administered during labor.
0	Avoid the use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection in pregnant women unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus, and if appropriate measures such as fetal monitoring are taken to detect and manage any potential adverse effect on the fetus.
0	The placental transfer of nalbuphine is high, rapid, and variable with a maternal to fetal ratio ranging from 1:0.37 to 1:6.
0	Fetal and neonatal adverse effects that have been reported following the administration of nalbuphine to the mother during labor include fetal bradycardia, respiratory depression at birth, apnea, cyanosis, and hypotonia.
0	Some of these events have been life-threatening.
0	Maternal administration of naloxone during labor has normalized these effects in some cases.
0	Severe and prolonged fetal bradycardia has been reported.
0	Permanent neurological damage attributed to fetal bradycardia has occurred.
0	A sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern associated with the use of nalbuphine has also been reported.
0	Nalbuphine should be used during labor and delivery only if clearly indicated and only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the infant.
0	Newborns should be monitored for respiratory depression, apnea, bradycardia and arrhythmias if nalbuphine has been used.
0	Nalbuphine hydrochloride is a synthetic opioid agonist-antagonist analgesic.
0	As an opioid, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse.
0	Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection.
0	Addiction can occur at recommended dosages and if the drug is misused or abused.
0	Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse.
0	Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g., major depression).
0	The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient.
0	Opioids are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion.
0	Consider these risks when prescribing or dispensing Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection.
0	Strategies to reduce these risks include prescribing the drug in the smallest appropriate quantity.
0	Contact local state professional licensing board or state controlled substances authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product.
0	Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility.
0	The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is a potent analgesic.
0	Its analgesic potency is essentially equivalent to that of morphine on a milligram basis.
0	Receptor studies show that nalbuphine hydrochloride binds to mu, kappa, and delta receptors, but not to sigma receptors.
0	Nalbuphine hydrochloride is primarily a kappa agonist/partial mu antagonist analgesic.
0	The onset of action of nalbuphine hydrochloride occurs within 2 to 3 minutes after intravenous administration, and in less than 15 minutes following subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.
0	The plasma half-life of nalbuphine is 5 hours, and in clinical studies the duration of analgesic activity has been reported to range from 3 to 6 hours.
0	The opioid antagonist activity of nalbuphine hydrochloride is one-fourth as potent as nalorphine and 10 times that of pentazocine.
0	Nalbuphine hydrochloride may produce the same degree of respiratory depression as equianalgesic doses of morphine.
0	However, Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection exhibits a ceiling effect such that increases in dose greater than 30 mg do not produce further respiratory depression in the absence of other CNS active medications affecting respiration.
0	Nalbuphine hydrochloride by itself has potent opioid antagonist activity at doses equal to or lower than its analgesic dose.
0	When administered following or concurrent with m<U+00B5> agonist opioid analgesics (e.g., morphine, oxymorphone, fentanyl), nalbuphine hydrochloride may partially reverse or block opioid-induced respiratory depression from the m<U+00B5> agonist analgesic.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection may precipitate withdrawal in patients dependent on opioid drugs.
0	Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection should be used with caution in patients who have been receiving mu opioid analgesics on a regular basis.
0	Serious harm or death could result if administered intravenously.
0	SUBLOCADE forms a solid mass upon contact with body fluids and may cause occlusion, local tissue damage, and thrombo-embolic events, including life threatening pulmonary emboli, if administered intravenously.
0	Because of the risk of serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration, SUBLOCADE is only available through a restricted program called the SUBLOCADE REMS Program.

0	Clean the injection site well with an alcohol swab.
0	To avoid irritation, rotate injection sites following a pattern similar to the illustration in Figure 4.
0	Record the location of the injection to ensure that a different site is used at the time of the next injection.
0	Figure 4 STEP 5: REMOVE EXCESS AIR FROM SYRINGE Hold the syringe upright for several seconds to allow air bubbles to rise.
0	Due to the viscous nature of the medication, bubbles will not rise as quickly as those in an aqueous solution.
0	Remove needle cover and slowly depress the plunger to push out the excess air from the syringe.
0	Small bubbles may remain in the medication.
0	Large air gaps, however, can be minimized by pulling back on the plunger rod to pop air bubbles prior to expelling the air very slowly.
0	Air should be expelled very carefully to avoid loss of medication.
0	If medication is seen at the needle tip, pull back slightly on the plunger to prevent medication spillage.
0	Figure 5 STEP 6: PINCH THE INJECTION SITE Pinch the skin around the injection area.
0	Be sure to pinch enough skin to accommodate the size of the needle.
0	Lift the adipose tissue from the underlying muscle to prevent accidental intramuscular injection.
0	Figure 6 STEP 7: INJECT THE MEDICATION SUBLOCADE is for subcutaneous injection only.
0	Do not inject intravenously or intramuscularly.
0	Insert needle fully into the abdominal subcutaneous tissue.
0	Actual angle of injection will depend on the amount of subcutaneous tissue.
0	Use a slow, steady push to inject the medication.
0	Continue pushing until all of the medication is given.
0	Figure 7 STEP 8: WITHDRAW THE NEEDLE Withdraw the needle at the same angle used for insertion and release the pinched skin.
0	Do not rub the injection area after the injection.
0	If there is bleeding, apply a gauze pad or bandage but use minimal pressure.
0	Figure 8 STEP 9: LOCK THE NEEDLE GUARD AND DISCARD THE SYRINGE Lock the needle guard into place by pushing it against a hard surface such as a table (Figure 9).
0	Dispose of all syringe components in a secure sharps disposal container.
0	Figure 9 STEP 10: INSTRUCT THE PATIENT Advise the patient that they may have a lump for several weeks that will decrease in size over time.
0	Instruct the patient not to rub or massage the injection site and to be aware of the placement of any belts or clothing waistbands.
0	Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 SUBLOCADE is subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program that includes, among other elements, a restricted distribution system.
0	The purpose of the restricted distribution system is to ensure that SUBLOCADE is only administered by a health care provider.
0	In the event the depot must be removed, it can be surgically excised under local anesthesia within 14 days of injection.
0	Only the most recently-injected depot can be removed.
0	The removed depot should be handled with adequate security, accountability, and proper disposal, per facility procedure for a Schedule III drug product and pharmaceutical biohazardous waste, and per applicable federal, state, and local regulations.
0	The residual plasma concentrations from previous injections will decrease gradually over subsequent months.
0	Patients who have the depot removed should be monitored for signs and symptoms of withdrawal and treated appropriately.
0	Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with SUBLOCADE.
0	Clinically Significant Drug Interactions Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Clinical Impact: Due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.
0	Intervention: Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use.
0	In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate.
0	In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.
0	Similarly, cessation of other CNS depressants is preferred when possible.Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines for anxiety or insomnia, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments.
0	Examples: Alcohol, non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids.
0	Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Clinical Impact: The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inhibitors on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied and the effects may be dependent on the route of administration; however, such interactions have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine.
0	Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity.The concomitant use of sublingual buprenorphine and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) can increase the plasma concentration of buprenorphine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects.
0	Intervention: Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors [e.g., azole antifungals such as ketoconazole, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, and saquinavir)] should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate.
1	If patients already on SUBLOCADE require newly-initiated treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors, the patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of over-medication.
0	Within 2 weeks of SUBLOCADE administration, if signs and symptoms of buprenorphine toxicity or overdose occur but the concomitant medication cannot be reduced or discontinued, it may be necessary to remove the depot and treat the patient with a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.
1	Conversely, if a patient has been stabilized on SUBLOCADE in the setting of concomitant medication that is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and the concomitant medication is discontinued, the patient should be monitored for withdrawal.
0	If the dose of SUBLOCADE is not adequate in the absence of the concomitant medication, that patient should be transitioned back to a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.
0	Examples: Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inducers on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied.Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity.CYP3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of buprenorphine and, therefore, may cause increased clearance of the drug which could lead to a decrease in buprenorphine plasma concentrations, lack of efficacy or, possibly, development of an abstinence syndrome.
0	Intervention: Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inducers should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate.
1	If patients already on SUBLOCADE require newly-initiated treatment with CYP3A4 inducers, the patients should be monitored for withdrawal.
0	If the dose of SUBLOCADE is not adequate in the absence of the concomitant medication, and the concomitant medication cannot be reduced or discontinued, that patient should be transitioned back to a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.
1	Conversely, if a patient has been stabilized on SUBLOCADE in the setting of concomitant medication that is a CYP3A4 inducer, and the concomitant medication is discontinued, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of over-medication.
0	Within 2 weeks of SUBLOCADE administration, if the dose provided by SUBLOCADE is excessive in the absence of the concomitant inducer, it may be necessary to remove the SUBLOCADE and treat the patient with a formulation of buprenorphine that permits dose adjustments.
0	Examples: Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital Antiretrovirals: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) Clinical Impact: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are metabolized principally by CYP3A4.
0	Efavirenz, nevirapine, and etravirine are known CYP3A inducers, whereas delavirdine is a CYP3A inhibitor.
0	Significant pharmacokinetic interactions between NNRTIs (e.g., efavirenz and delavirdine) and sublingual buprenorphine have been shown in clinical studies, but these pharmacokinetic interactions did not result in any significant pharmacodynamic effects.
0	Intervention: Patients who are on chronic treatment with SUBLOCADE should be monitored for increase or decrease in therapeutic effects if NNRTIs are added to their treatment regimen.
0	Examples: Efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, delavirdine Antiretrovirals: Protease inhibitors (PIs) Clinical Impact: Studies have shown some antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir) have little effect on sublingual buprenorphine pharmacokinetic and no significant pharmacodynamic effects.
0	Other PIs with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine after sublingual administration, and patients in one study reported increased sedation.
0	Symptoms of opioid excess have been found in postmarketing reports of patients receiving sublingual buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly.
1	Intervention: If treatment with atazanavir with and without ritonavir must be initiated in a patient already treated with SUBLOCADE, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of over-medication.
0	It may be necessary to remove the depot and treat the patient with a sublingual buprenorphine product that permits rapid dose adjustments.
0	Examples: Atazanavir, ritonavir Antiretrovirals: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) Clinical Impact: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) do not appear to induce or inhibit the P450 enzyme pathway, thus no interactions with buprenorphine are expected.
0	Intervention: None Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.
0	Intervention: If concomitant use is warranted, carefully monitor the patient for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation, and during dose adjustment of the serotonergic drug.
0	Examples: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).
0	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact: MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma).
0	Intervention: The use of SUBLOCADE is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.
0	Examples: Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid Muscle Relaxants Clinical Impact: Buprenorphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
0	Intervention: Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and SUBLOCADE for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of the muscle relaxant as necessary.
0	Diuretics Clinical Impact: Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.
0	Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.
0	Anticholinergic Drugs Clinical Impact: The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase the risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.
0	Intervention: Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when SUBLOCADE is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.
0	CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers: Monitor patients starting or ending CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers for potential over- or under-dosing.
0	Serotonergic Drugs: If concomitant use is warranted, monitor for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation, and during dose adjustment of the serotonergic drug.
0	Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse: Buprenorphine can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids.
0	Monitor patients for conditions indicative of diversion or progression of opioid dependence and addictive behaviors.
0	Respiratory Depression: Life-threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in association with buprenorphine.
0	Warn patients of the potential danger of self-administration of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants while under treatment with SUBLOCADE.
0	Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome: Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy.
0	Adrenal Insufficiency: If diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement of corticosteroids, and wean patient off of the opioid.
0	Risk of Opioid Withdrawal With Abrupt Discontinuation: If treatment with SUBLOCADE is discontinued, monitor patients for several months for withdrawal and treat appropriately.
0	Risk of Hepatitis, Hepatic Events: Monitor liver function tests prior to and during treatment.
0	Risk of Withdrawal in Patients Dependent on Full Agonist Opioids: Verify that patient is clinically stable on transmucosal buprenorphine before injecting SUBLOCADE.
0	Treatment of Emergent Acute Pain: Treat pain with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible.
0	If opioid therapy is required, monitor patients closely because higher doses may be required for analgesic effect.
0	Intravenous injection presents significant risk of serious harm or death as SUBLOCADE forms a solid mass upon contact with body fluids.
0	Occlusion, local tissue damage, and thrombo-embolic events, including life threatening pulmonary emboli, could result if administered intravenously.
0	Do not administer intravenously or intramuscularly.
0	SUBLOCADE is available only through a restricted program called the SUBLOCADE REMS Program because of the risk of serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration.
0	The goal of the REMS is to mitigate serious harm or death that could result from intravenous self-administration by ensuring that healthcare settings and pharmacies are certified and only dispense SUBLOCADE directly to a healthcare provider for administration by a health care provider.
0	Notable requirements of the SUBLOCADE REMS Program include the following: Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies that order and dispense SUBLOCADE must be certified in the SUBLOCADE REMS Program.
0	Certified Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies must establish processes and procedures to verify SUBLOCADE is provided directly to a healthcare provider for administration by a healthcare provider, and the drug is not dispensed to the patient.
0	Certified Healthcare Settings and Pharmacies must not distribute, transfer, loan, or sell SUBLOCADE.
0	Further information is available at www.SublocadeREMS.com or call 1-866-258-3905.
0	SUBLOCADE contains buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance that can be abused in a manner similar to other opioids.
0	Buprenorphine is sought by people with opioid use disorder and is subject to criminal diversion.
0	Monitor all patients for progression of opioid use disorder and addictive behaviors.
0	Buprenorphine has been associated with life-threatening respiratory depression and death.
0	Many, but not all, postmarketing reports regarding coma and death involved misuse by self-injection or were associated with the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol.
0	Use SUBLOCADE with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression).
0	Due to its extended-release characteristics, if SUBLOCADE is discontinued as a result of compromised respiratory function, monitor patients for ongoing buprenorphine effects for several months.
0	Concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants increases the risk of adverse reactions including overdose, respiratory depression, and death.
0	Medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder, however, should not be categorically denied to patients taking these drugs.
0	Prohibiting or creating barriers to treatment can pose an even greater risk of morbidity and mortality due to the opioid use disorder alone.
0	As a routine part of orientation to buprenorphine treatment, educate patients about the risks of concomitant use of benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol.
0	Develop strategies to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of buprenorphine treatment, or if it emerges as a concern during treatment.
0	Adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required.
0	There is no evidence to support dose limitations or arbitrary caps of buprenorphine as a strategy to address benzodiazepine use in buprenorphine-treated patients.
0	However, if a patient is sedated at the time of buprenorphine dosing, delay or omit the buprenorphine dose if appropriate.
0	Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use with buprenorphine.
0	For patients in buprenorphine treatment, benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia.
0	Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments to address anxiety or insomnia.
0	Ensure that other healthcare providers prescribing benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants are aware of the patient's buprenorphine treatment and coordinate care to minimize the risks associated with concomitant use.
0	In addition, take measures to confirm that patients are taking their medications as prescribed and are not diverting or supplementing with illicit drugs.
0	Toxicology screening should test for prescribed and illicit benzodiazepines.
0	Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is an expected and treatable outcome of prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy, whether that use is medically-authorized or illicit.
0	Unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, NOWS may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated in the neonate.
0	Healthcare professionals should observe newborns for signs of NOWS and manage accordingly.
0	Advise pregnant women receiving opioid addiction treatment with SUBLOCADE of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.
0	This risk should be balanced against the risk of untreated opioid addiction which often results in continued or relapsing illicit opioid use and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.
0	Therefore, prescribers should discuss the importance of management of opioid addiction throughout pregnancy.
0	Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use.
0	Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure.
0	If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible.
0	If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids.
0	Wean the patient off the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers.
0	Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency.
0	The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.
0	Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and chronic administration produces physical dependence of the opioid type, characterized by withdrawal signs and symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation.
0	The withdrawal syndrome is milder than that seen with full agonists and may be delayed in onset.
0	Withdrawal signs and symptoms were not observed in the month following discontinuation of SUBLOCADE.
0	Considering the long half-life, any withdrawal signs and symptoms that may occur would be expected to be delayed.
0	Model simulations indicate that steady-state buprenorphine plasma concentrations decreased slowly over time following the last injection and remained at therapeutic levels for 2 to 5 months on average, depending on the dosage administered (100 or 300 mg, respectively).
0	Patients who elect to discontinue treatment with SUBLOCADE should be monitored for withdrawal signs and symptoms.
0	Consider transmucosal buprenorphine if needed to treat withdrawal after discontinuing SUBLOCADE.
0	Cases of cytolytic hepatitis and hepatitis with jaundice have been observed in individuals receiving buprenorphine in clinical trials and through postmarketing adverse event reports.
0	The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of death, hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy.
0	In many cases, the presence of pre-existing liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs, and ongoing injecting drug use may have played a causative or contributory role.
0	In other cases, insufficient data were available to determine the etiology of the abnormality.
0	Withdrawal of buprenorphine has resulted in amelioration of acute hepatitis in some cases, however, in other cases no dose reduction was necessary.
0	The possibility exists that buprenorphine had a causative or contributory role in the development of the hepatic abnormality in some cases.
0	In one subject in the SUBLOCADE clinical program, surgical removal was followed by improvement in liver enzymes.
0	Liver function tests, prior to initiation of treatment, are recommended to establish a baseline.
0	Monthly monitoring of liver function during treatment, particularly with 300 mg maintenance dose, is also recommended.
0	An etiological evaluation is recommended when a hepatic adverse event is suspected.
0	Cases of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine-containing products have been reported both in clinical trials and in the postmarketing experience.
0	Cases of bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock have been reported.
0	The most common signs and symptoms include rashes, hives, and pruritus.
0	A history of hypersensitivity to buprenorphine is a contraindication to the use of SUBLOCADE.
0	Because of the partial opioid agonist properties of buprenorphine, buprenorphine may precipitate opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms in persons who are currently physically dependent on full opioid agonists such as heroin, morphine, or methadone before the effects of the full opioid agonist have subsided.
0	Verify that patients have tolerated and are dose adjusted on transmucosal buprenorphine before subcutaneously injecting SUBLOCADE.
0	While on SUBLOCADE, situations may arise where patients need acute pain management, or may require anesthesia.
0	Treat patients receiving SUBLOCADE with a non-opioid analgesic whenever possible.
0	Patients requiring opioid therapy for analgesia may be treated with a high-affinity full opioid analgesic under the supervision of a physician, with particular attention to respiratory function.
0	Higher doses may be required for analgesic effect.
0	Therefore, a higher potential for toxicity exists with opioid administration.
0	If opioid therapy is required as part of anesthesia, patients should be continuously monitored in an anesthesia care setting by persons not involved in the conduct of the surgical or diagnostic procedure.
0	The opioid therapy should be provided by individuals specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, specifically the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation.
0	Advise patients of the importance of instructing their family members, in the event of emergency, to inform the treating healthcare provider or emergency room staff that the patient is physically dependent on an opioid and that the patient is being treated with SUBLOCADE.
0	The above guidance should also be considered for any patient who has been treated with SUBLOCADE within the last 6 months.
0	There have been reported deaths of opioid na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve individuals who received a 2 mg dose of buprenorphine as a sublingual tablet.
0	SUBLOCADE is not appropriate for use in opioid na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve patients.
0	In a pharmacokinetic study with transmucosal buprenorphine, buprenorphine plasma levels were found to be higher and the half-life was found to be longer in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, but not in subjects with mild hepatic impairment.
0	The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SUBLOCADE has not been studied.
0	Because of the long-acting nature of the product, adjustments to dosages of SUBLOCADE are not rapidly reflected in plasma buprenorphine levels.
0	Because buprenorphine levels cannot be rapidly decreased, patients with pre-existing moderate to severe hepatic impairment are not candidates for treatment with SUBLOCADE.
0	Patients who develop moderate to severe hepatic impairment while being treated with SUBLOCADE should be monitored for several months for signs and symptoms of toxicity or overdose caused by increased levels of buprenorphine.
0	Buprenorphine has been observed to prolong the QTc interval in some patients participating in clinical trials.
0	Consider these observations in clinical decisions when prescribing buprenorphine to patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or clinically unstable cardiac disease, including unstable atrial fibrillation, symptomatic bradycardia, unstable congestive heart failure, or active myocardial ischemia.
0	Periodic electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended in these patients.
0	Avoid the use of buprenorphine in patients with a history of Long QT Syndrome or an immediate family member with this condition or those taking Class IA antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or Class III antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide), or other medications that prolong the QT interval.
0	SUBLOCADE may impair the mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially dangerous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery especially during the first few days following treatment and dose adjustment.
0	Buprenorphine plasma levels accumulate during the first two months and are maintained with the 100 mg maintenance dose; further accumulation occurs with the 300 mg maintenance dose, which achieves steady-state after the fourth monthly injection.
0	Caution patients about driving or operating hazardous machinery until they are reasonably certain that SUBLOCADE does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.
0	Buprenorphine may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients.
0	Buprenorphine may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure and should be used with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, and other circumstances when cerebrospinal pressure may be increased.
0	Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.
0	Buprenorphine has been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure, as do other opioids, and thus should be administered with caution to patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract.
0	Buprenorphine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.
0	Buprenorphine can cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children who are accidentally exposed to it.
0	SUBLOCADE Injection contains buprenorphine.
0	Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu- opioid receptor and an antagonist at the kappa-opioid receptor.
0	Mu-Opioid Receptor Occupancy and Association With Opioid Blockade In a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study with SUBLOCADE in 2 subjects (one subject receiving 200 mg SC injections and one subject receiving 300 mg SC injections) with opioid use disorder, 75 to 92% occupancy of the mu-opioid receptors in the brain was maintained for 28 days following the last dose under steady-state conditions.
0	The opioid blockade study evaluated the blockade of subjective opioid effects, pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of SC injections of SUBLOCADE.
0	Stabilization doses of SL buprenorphine prior to injection of SUBLOCADE failed to provide full blockade of subjective effects of hydromorphone 18 mg IM.
0	After SUBLOCADE injections at Weeks 0 and 4, on average, subjective effects of both 6 mg and 18 mg doses of hydromorphone were blocked; however, wide variability was seen across subjects.
0	Complete blockade continued throughout the 8 weeks of observation that followed the 2nd SUBLOCADE injection.
0	Figure 10 illustrates the relationship between buprenorphine plasma level and drug liking after 18 mg hydromorphone IM.
0	Plasma Buprenorphine Concentration Following 18 mg Hydromorphone Challenges Exposure-response relationships were assessed for illicit opioid use, based on urine samples negative for illicit opioids combined with self-reports negative for illicit opioid use, and withdrawal symptoms using data obtained from 489 opioid dependent patients in the double-blind Phase 3 Study (13-0001).
0	The observed plateau for maximal response was reached at buprenorphine plasma concentrations of approximately 2-3 ng/mL for illicit opioid use and 4 ng/mL for opioid withdrawal symptoms.
0	Population PK/PD modeling indicated that patients using opioids by the injectable route at baseline may require higher buprenorphine exposure compared to patients not using opioids by the injectable route at baseline.
0	Figure 10 Cardiac Electrophysiology Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to evaluate the effect of SUBLOCADE on the QT interval in five clinical studies including the Phase 3 study.
0	In a Phase 3 study, seven patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec at any time [2/203 patients (1.0%) in the 300 mg/100 mg group and 5/201 patients (2.0%) in the 300 mg/300 mg group] and one patient in the 300 mg/300 mg group was found to have a QTc greater than 500 msec.
0	These QTc findings were all sporadic and transient and none led to aberrant ventricular rhythm.
0	Review of ECG and adverse event data provided no evidence for syncope, seizure, or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
0	Physiological Effects Buprenorphine in IV (2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses have been administered to opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for treatment of opioid dependence.
0	Compared to placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O2 saturation, or skin temperature across time.
0	Systolic BP was higher in the 8 mg group than placebo (3 hour AUC values).
0	Minimum and maximum effects were similar across all treatments.
0	Subjects remained responsive to low voice and responded to computer prompts.
0	Some subjects showed irritability, but no other changes were observed.
0	The respiratory effects of sublingual buprenorphine were compared with the effects of methadone in a double-blind, parallel group, dose ranging comparison of single doses of buprenorphine sublingual solution (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg) and oral methadone (15, 30, 45, or 60 mg) in non-dependent, opioid-experienced volunteers.
0	In this study, hypoventilation not requiring medical intervention was reported more frequently after buprenorphine doses of 4 mg and higher than after methadone.
0	Both drugs decreased O2 saturation to the same degree.
0	In clinical studies conducted with SUBLOCADE at doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg, no incidences of temperature elevations, or clinically significant lowering of oxygen saturation were observed.
0	Androgen Deficiency Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility.
0	The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date.
0	Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.
0	Absorption The pharmacokinetics (PK) of buprenorphine following subcutaneous injection of SUBLOCADE was evaluated in subjects with opioid use disorder after single doses (50 mg to 200 mg) and repeated doses (50 to 300 mg) separated by 28 days for up to 12 injections.
0	After SUBLOCADE injection, an initial buprenorphine peak was observed and the median Tmax occurred at 24 hours after injection.
0	After the initial buprenorphine peak, the plasma buprenorphine concentrations decreased slowly to a plateau.
0	Observed mean buprenorphine concentrations levels for Cavg, Cmax and Cmin are presented in Table 6.

0	Elimination Buprenorphine is metabolized and eliminated in urine and feces.
0	The apparent terminal plasma half-life of buprenorphine following subcutaneous injection of SUBLOCADE ranged between 43 to 60 days as a result of the slow release of buprenorphine from the subcutaneous depot.
0	Metabolism Buprenorphine is metabolized to its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, primarily by CYP3A4.
0	Norbuprenorphine can further undergo glucuronidation.
0	Norbuprenorphine has been found to bind opioid receptors in vitro; however, it has not been studied clinically for opioid-like activity.
0	Norbuprenorphine steady-state plasma concentrations in humans after subcutaneous injection of SUBLOCADE are low compared to buprenorphine (AUC norbuprenorphine/buprenorphine ratio of 0.20 to 0.40).
0	Excretion A mass balance study of buprenorphine administered by IV infusion in humans showed complete recovery of radiolabel in urine (30%) and feces (69%) collected up to 11 days after dosing.
0	Almost all of the dose was accounted for in terms of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and two unidentified buprenorphine metabolites.
0	In urine, most of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were conjugated (buprenorphine: 1% free and 9.4% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 2.7% free and 11% conjugated).
0	In feces, almost all of the buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were free (buprenorphine: 33% free and 5% conjugated; norbuprenorphine: 21% free and 2% conjugated).
0	Drug Interaction Studies CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers on buprenorphine exposure in subjects treated with SUBLOCADE have not been studied; however, such interactions have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine.
0	The effects of buprenorphine may be dependent on the route of administration.
0	Buprenorphine is metabolized to norbuprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4; therefore, potential interactions may occur when SUBLOCADE is given concurrently with agents that affect CYP3A4 activity.
0	The effects of co-administered CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors have been established in studies using transmucosal buprenorphine.
0	Patients who transfer to SUBLOCADE treatment from a regimen of transmucosal buprenorphine used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), or HIV protease inhibitors, or CYP3A4 inducer (e.g., phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) should be monitored to ensure that the plasma buprenorphine level provided by SUBLOCADE is adequate and not excessive.
0	Buprenorphine has been found to be a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor and its major metabolite, norbuprenorphine, has been found to be a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor in in vitro studies employing human liver microsomes.
0	However, the plasma concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine resulting from therapeutic SUBLOCADE doses are not expected to significantly affect metabolism of other co-medications.
0	Specific Populations Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses, age, sex and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on PK of SUBLOCADE.
0	Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SUBLOCADE has not been studied.
0	However, the effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of buprenorphine has been evaluated in a study using 2 mg/0.5 mg buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablet in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment as indicated by Child-Pugh criteria.
0	While no clinically relevant changes were observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, buprenorphine plasma exposure was increased by 64% and 181% in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, respectively, compared to healthy subjects.
0	Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of SUBLOCADE has not been studied.
0	Clinical studies of SUBLOCADE did not include subjects with severe renal impairment.
0	Less than 1% is excreted as unchanged buprenorphine in urine following IV buprenorphine administration.
0	No differences in buprenorphine pharmacokinetics were observed between 9 dialysis-dependent and 6 normal patients following IV administration of 0.3 mg buprenorphine.
0	Population PK analyses indicated no notable relationship between creatinine clearance and steady-state buprenorphine plasma concentrations.
0	HCV infection In subjects with HCV infection but no sign of hepatic impairment, the changes in the mean Cmax, AUC0-last, and half-life values of buprenorphine were not clinically significant in comparison to healthy subjects without HCV infection.
0	No dose adjustment is needed in patients with HCV infection.
0	Meclizine hydrochloride is contraindicated in individuals who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to it.
0	The recommended dosage is 25 mg to 100 mg daily administered orally, in divided dosage, depending upon clinical response.
0	Pediatric Use Clinical studies establishing safety and effectiveness in children have not been done; therefore, usage is not recommended in children under 12 years of age.
0	Pregnancy Category B. Reproduction studies in rats have shown cleft palates at 25 to 50 times the human dose.
0	Epidemiological studies in pregnant women, however, do not indicate that meclizine increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy.
0	Despite the animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is remote.
0	Nevertheless, meclizine, or any other medication, should be used during pregnancy only if clearly necessary.
0	Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
0	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when meclizine is administered to a nursing woman.
0	Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated.
0	As meclizine undergoes metabolism, hepatic impairment may result in increased systemic exposure of the drug.
0	Treatment with meclizine should be administered with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
0	Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of meclizine has not been evaluated.
0	Due to a potential for drug/metabolite accumulation, meclizine should be administered with caution in patients with renal impairment and in the elderly as renal function generally declines with age.
0	Drug Interactions There may be increased CNS depression when meclizine is administered concurrently with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, tranquilizers and sedatives.
0	Based on in vitro evaluation, meclizine is metabolized by CYP2D6.
0	Therefore there is a possibility for a drug interaction between meclizine and CYP2D6 inhibitors.
0	Since drowsiness may, on occasion, occur with use of this drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery.
0	Patients should avoid alcoholic beverages while taking this drug.
0	Due to its potential anticholinergic action, this drug should be used with caution in patients with asthma, glaucoma, or enlargement of the prostate gland.
0	Meclizine hydrochloride is an antihistamine that shows marked protective activity against nebulized histamine and lethal doses of intravenously injected histamine in guinea pigs.
0	It has a marked effect in blocking the vasodepressor response to histamine, but only a slight blocking action against acetylcholine.
0	Its activity is relatively weak in inhibiting the spasmogenic action of histamine on isolated guinea pig ileum.
0	Pharmacokinetics The available pharmacokinetic information for meclizine following oral administration has been summarized from published literature.
0	Absorption Meclizine is absorbed after oral administration with maximum plasma concentrations reaching at a median Tmax value of 3 hours post-dose (range: 1.5 to 6 hours) for the tablet dosage form.
0	Distribution Drug distribution characteristics for meclizine in humans are unknown.
0	Metabolism The metabolic fate of meclizine in humans is unknown.
0	In an in vitro metabolic study using human hepatic microsome and recombinant CYP enzyme, CYP2D6 was found to be the dominant enzyme for metabolism of meclizine.
0	The genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6 that results in extensive-, poor-, intermediate- and ultrarapid metabolizer phenotypes could contribute to large inter-individual variability in meclizine exposure.
0	Elimination Meclizine has a plasma elimination half-life of about 5 to 6 hours in humans.
0	The product should not be used if there is hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.
0	AVITA<U+00AE> Gel should be applied once a day, in the evening, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly.
0	Application may cause a transient feeling of warmth or slight stinging.
0	In cases where it has been necessary to temporarily discontinue therapy or reduce the frequency of application, therapy may be resumed or frequency of application increased when the patients become able to tolerate the treatment.
0	Alterations of dose frequency should be closely monitored by careful observation of the clinical therapeutic response and skin tolerance.
0	Efficacy has not been established for less than once-daily dosing frequencies.
0	During the early weeks of therapy, an apparent increase in number and exacerbation of inflammatory acne lesions may occur.
0	This is due, in part, to the action of the medication on deep, previously unseen lesions and should not be considered a reason to discontinue therapy.
0	Therapeutic results should be noticed after two to three weeks, but more than six weeks of therapy may be required before definite beneficial effects are seen.
0	Patients treated with AVITA<U+00AE> Gel may use cosmetics, but the areas to be treated should be cleansed thoroughly before the medication is applied.
0	Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin.
0	Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with AVITA<U+00AE> Gel.
0	It also is advisable to <U+201C>rest<U+201D> a patient<U+2019>s skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of AVITA<U+00AE> Gel is begun.
0	If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued.
0	Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps or artificial sunlight should be minimized during the use of AVITA<U+00AE> Gel, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin.
0	Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution.
0	Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided.
0	Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin.
0	AVITA<U+00AE> (tretinoin gel) Gel, 0.025% should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, the paranasal creases, and mucous membranes.Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application.
0	If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to temporarily use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether.
0	Efficacy at reduced frequencies of application has not been established.
0	Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition.
0	In a dermal mouse carcinogenicity study with AVITA<U+00AE> Gel, tretinoin was administered to CD-1 mice at topical doses of 0.027 mg/kg (0.003% gel), 0.072 mg/kg (0.008% gel), and 0.225 mg/kg (0.025% gel) for 2 years (5 doses/week).
0	No drug-related tumors were noted in this mouse carcinogenicity study up to the highest dose evaluated in this study of 0.225 mg/kg in both male and female mice, which was 2.6 times the recommended human topical clinical dose (based on weekly dose BSA comparison).
0	For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to human exposure, the <U+201C>recommended human topical clinical dose<U+201D> is defined as 1.0 g of 0.025% AVITA<U+00AE> Gel applied daily to a 50 kg person.
0	In a chronic, two-year bioassay of vitamin A acid in mice performed by Tsubura and Yamamoto, generalized amyloid deposition was reported in all vitamin A treated groups in the basal layer of the skin.
0	In CD-1 mice, a similar study reported hyalinization at the treated skin sites and the incidence of this finding was 0/50, 3/50, 3/50, and 2/50 in male mice and 1/50, 0/50, 4/50, and 2/50 in female mice from the vehicle control, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1 mg/kg groups, respectively.
0	Studies in hairless albino mice suggest that tretinoin may enhance the tumorigenic potential of carcinogenic doses of UVA and UVB light from a solar simulator.
0	In other studies, when lightly pigmented hairless mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to carcinogenic doses of UVA/UVB light, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors were either reduced or no effect was seen.
0	Due to significantly different experimental conditions, no strict comparison of these disparate data is possible at this time.
0	Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear, patients should minimize exposure to sun.
0	The mutagenic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in the Ames assay and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, both of which were negative.
0	Dermal Segment I and III studies with AVITA<U+00AE> Gel have not been performed in any species.
0	In oral Segment I and Segment III studies in rats with tretinoin, decreased survival of neonates and growth retardation were observed at doses in excess of 2 mg/kg/day (> 400 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose).
0	Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats, mice, rabbits, hamsters, and subhuman primates.
0	It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in rats when given orally in doses 1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose.
0	However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported.
0	In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day (1000 times the average recommended human topical clinical dose), although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses.
0	Dose-related increased embryolethality and abortion were reported.
0	Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques.
0	Topical tretinoin in animal teratogenicity tests has generated equivocal results.
0	There is evidence for teratogenicity (shortened or kinked tail) of topical tretinoin in Wistar rats at doses greater than 1 mg/kg/day (200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose).
0	Anomalies (humerus: short 13%, bent 6%; os parietal incompletely ossified 14%) have also been reported in rats when 10 mg/kg/day was dermally applied.
0	Topical tretinoin (AVITA<U+00AE> Gel, 0.025%) has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits when given in doses 364 times the topical human dose for gel (assuming a 50 kg adult applies 1.0 g of 0.025% gel topically).
0	In this study, increased incidence of cleft palate and hydrocephaly was reported in the tretinoin-treated animals.
0	There are other reports, in New Zealand White rabbits with doses of approximately 80 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, of an increased incidence of domed head and hydrocephaly, typical of retinoid-induced fetal malformations in this species.
0	When given subcutaneously to rabbits, tretinoin was teratogenic at 2 mg/kg/day but not at 1 mg/kg/day.
0	These doses are approximately 400 and 200 times, respectively, the human topical dose of tretinoin gel, 0.025% (assuming a 50 kg adult applies 1.0 g of 0.025% gel topically).
0	In contrast, several well-controlled animal studies have shown that dermally applied tretinoin was not teratogenic at doses of 100 and 200 times the recommended human topical clinical dose, in rats and rabbits, respectively.
0	With widespread use of any drug, a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone.
0	Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during two decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin (Retin-A).
0	Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases, 5 of the reports describe the rare birth defect category, holoprosencephaly (defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain).
0	The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to the fetus is not known.
0	Dermal tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered in doses 100 times the recommended topical human clinical dose.
0	Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rats when administered in doses 500 times the recommended topical human clinical dose.

0	AVITA<U+00AE> (tretinoin gel) Gel, 0.025% should not be used during pregnancy.
0	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when AVITA<U+00AE> Gel is administered to a nursing woman.
0	Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation.
0	Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones.
0	In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies with AVITA<U+00AE> Gel indicate that less than 0.3% of the topically applied dose is bioavailable.
0	Circulating plasma levels of both tretinoin and isotretinoin are only slightly elevated above those found in healthy normal controls.
0	In two large vehicle-controlled clinical trials, AVITA<U+00AE> (tretinoin gel) Gel 0.025%, applied once daily was more effective than vehicle in the treatment of facial acne vulgaris of mild to moderate severity.

0	Patients<U+2019> self-medication habits should be investigated to determine their use of such medications.
0	Triacin-C is intended for short-term use only.
0	Information For Patients:Advise patients that some people have a genetic variation that results in codeine changing into morphine more rapidly and completely than other people.
0	Most people are unaware of whether they are an ultra-rapid codeine metabolizer or not.
0	These higher-than-normal levels of morphine in the blood may lead to life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or signs of overdose such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing.
0	Children with this genetic variation who were prescribed codeine after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnea may be at greatest risk based on reports of several deaths in this population due to respiratory depression.

0	This product may diminish the antihypertensive effects of guanethidine, bethanidine, methyldopa and reserpine.
0	Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Codeine: Narcotic administration may increase serum amylase levels.
0	Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility: No adequate studies have been conducted in animals to determine whether the components of Triacin-C have a potential for carcinogenesis, mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.
0	Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects <U+2013> Pregnancy category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Triacin-C.
0	It is also not known whether this product can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.
0	This product should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
0	Teratology studies have been conducted with the three ingredients of Triacin-C. Pseudoephedrine studies were conducted in rats at doses up to 150 times the human dose; triprolidine was studied in rats and rabbits at doses up to 125 times the human dose, and codeine studies were conducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 150 times the human dose.
0	No evidence of teratogenic harm to the fetus was revealed in any of these studies.

0	This was reflected in reduced average weight and length and rate of skeletal ossification in their fetuses.
0	Nursing Mothers: The components of Triacin-C are excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but the significance of their effects on nursing infants is not known.
0	Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from maternal ingestion of this product, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
0	Pediatric Use: Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children with obstructive sleep apnea who received codeine in the post-operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and had evidence of being ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2D6 or high morphine concentrations).
0	These children may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine that has been rapidly metabolized to morphine.
0	Codeine is contraindicated for post-operative pain management in these patients As in adults, the combination of an antihistamine, sympathomimetic amine and codeine can elicit either mild stimulation or mild sedation in pediatric patients.
0	In pediatric patients particularly, the ingredients in this drug product in overdosage may produce hallucinations, convulsions and death.
0	Symptoms of toxicity in pediatric patients may include fixed dilated pupils, flushed face, dry mouth, fever, excitation, hallucinations, ataxia, incoordination, athetosis, tonic clonic convulsions and postictal depression,.
0	Use In Elderly (Approximately 60 Years Or Older): The ingredients in Triacin-C are more likely to cause adverse reactions in elderly patients.
0	Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine in the post<U+00AD>operative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy and had evidence of being ultra<U+00AD>rapid metabolizers of codeine (i.e., multiple copies of the gene for cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 or high morphine concentrations).
0	Deaths have also occurred in nursing infants who were exposed to high levels of morphine in breast milk because their mothers were ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.
0	Some individuals may be ultra-rapid metabolizers because of a specific CYP2D6 genotype (gene duplications denoted as *1/*1xN or *1/*2xN).
0	The prevalence of this CYP2D6 phenotype varies widely and has been estimated at 0.5 to 1% in Chinese and Japanese, 0.5 to 1% in Hispanics, 1 to 10% in Caucasians, 3% in African Americans, and 16 to 28% in North Africans, Ethiopians, and Arabs.
0	Data are not available for other ethnic groups.
0	These individuals convert codeine into its active metabolite, morphine, more rapidly and completely than other people.
0	This rapid conversion results in higher than expected serum morphine levels.
0	Even at labeled dosage regimens, individuals who are ultra-rapid metabolizers may have life-threatening or fatal respiratory depression or experience signs of overdose (such as extreme sleepiness, confusion, or shallow breathing).
0	Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine for post-tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy pain may be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine that has been rapidly metabolized to morphine.
0	Codeine is contraindicated for post-operative pain management in all pediatric patients undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.
0	When prescribing codeine-containing drugs, healthcare providers should choose the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time and inform patients and caregivers about these risks and the signs of morphine overdose.
0	Triacin-C should be used with considerable caution in patients with increased intraocular pressure (narrow angle glaucoma), stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and hyperthyroidism.
0	In the presence of head injury or other intracranial lesions, the respiratory depressant effects of codeine and other narcotics may be markedly enhanced, as well as their capacity for elevating cerebrospinal fluid pressure.
0	Narcotics also produce other CNS depressant effects, such as drowsiness, that may further obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.
0	Codeine or other narcotics may obscure signs on which to judge the diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.
0	Codeine: Codeine probably exerts its antitussive activity by depressing the medullary (brain) cough center, thereby raising its threshold for incoming cough impulses.
0	Codeine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with a therapeutic dose reaching peak antitussive effectiveness in about 2 hours and persisting for 4 to 6 hours.
0	Codeine is rapidly distributed from blood to body tissues and taken up preferentially by parenchymatous organs such as liver, spleen and kidney.
0	It passes the blood brain barrier and is found in fetal tissue and breast milk.
0	The drug is not bound by plasma proteins nor is it accumulated in body tissues.
0	Codeine is metabolized in the liver to morphine and norcodeine, each representing about 10 percent of the administered codeine dose.
0	About 90 percent of the dose is excreted within 24 hours, primarily through the kidneys.
0	Urinary excretion products are free and glucuronide-conjugated codeine (about 70%), free and conjugated norcodeine (about 10%), free and conjugated morphine (about 10%), normorphine (under 4%) and hydrocodone (<1%).
0	The remainder of the dose appears in the feces.
0	Triprolidine: Antihistamines such as triprolidine hydrochloride act as antagonists of the H1 histamine receptor.
0	Consequently, they prevent histamine from eliciting typical immediate hypersensitivity responses in the nose, eyes, lungs and skin.
0	Animal distribution studies have shown localization of triprolidine in lung, spleen and kidney tissue.
0	Liver microsome studies have revealed the presence of several metabolites with an oxidized product of the toluene methyl group predominating.
0	Pseudoephedrine: Pseudoephedrine acts as an indirect sympathomimetic agent by stimulating sympathetic (adrenergic) nerve endings to release norepinephrine.
0	Norepinephrine in turn stimulates alpha and beta receptors throughout the body.
0	The action of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is apparently more specific for the blood vessels of the upper respiratory tract and less specific for the blood vessels of the systemic circulation.
0	The vasoconstriction elicited at these sites results in the shrinkage of swollen tissues in the sinuses and nasal passages.
0	Pseudoephedrine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
0	Considerable variation in half-life has been observed (from about 4<U+00BD> to 10 hours), which is attributed to individual differences in absorption and excretion.
0	Excretion rates are also altered by urine pH, increasing with acidification and decreasing with alkalinization.
0	As a result, mean half-life falls to about 4 hours at pH 5 and increases to 12 to 13 hours at pH 8.
0	After administration of a 60 mg tablet, 87 to 96% of the pseudoephedrine is cleared from the body within 24 hours.
0	The drug is distributed to body tissues and fluids, including fetal tissue, breast milk and the central nervous system (CNS).
0	About 55 to 75% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine; the remainder is apparently metabolized in the liver to inactive compounds by N-demethylation, parahydroxylation and oxidative deamination.
0	Hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.
0	Patients with severe renal disease will accumulate aminosalicylic acid and its acetyl metabolite but will continue to acetylate, thus leading exclusively to the inactive acetylated form; deacetylation, if any, is not significant.
0	The half life of free aminosalicylic acid in renal disease is 30.8 minutes in comparison to 26.4 minutes in normal volunteers. but the half life of the inactive metabolite is 309 minutes in uremic patients in comparison to 51 minutes in normal volunteers.
0	Although aminosalicylic acid passes dialysis membranes, the frequency of dialysis usually is not comparable to the half-life of 50 minutes for the free acid.
0	Patients with end stage renal disease should not receive aminosalicylic acid.
0	PASER granules should be administered with other drugs to which the organism is known or expected to be susceptible.
0	It is most commonly administered to patients with Multi-drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) or in other situations in which therapy with isoniazid or rifampin is not possible due to a combination of resistance and/or intolerance.
0	The adult dosage of four grams (one packet) three times per day or correspondingly smaller doses in children should be given by sprinkling on apple sauce or yogurt or by swirling in the glass to suspend the granules in an acidic drink such as tomato or orange juice.
0	DO NOT USE if packet is swollen or the granules have lost their tan color, turning dark brown or purple.
1	Aminosalicylic acid at a dosage of 12 grams in a rapidly available form has been reported to produce a 20 percent reduction in the acetylation of isoniazid, especially in patients who are rapid acetylators; INH serum levels, half lives and excretions in fast acetylators still remain half of the levels seen in slow acetylators with or without p-aminosalicylic acid.
0	The effect is dose related and, while it has not been studied with the current delayed release preparation, the lower serum levels with this preparation will result in a reduced effect on the acetylation of INH.
1	Aminosalicylic acid has previously been reported to block the absorption of rifampin.
0	A subsequent report has shown that this blockade was due to an excipient not included in PASER granules.
0	Oral administration of a solution containing both aminosalicylic acid and rifampin showed full absorption of each product.
0	As a result of competition, Vitamin B12 absorption has been reduced 55% by 5 grams of aminosalicylic acid with clinically significant erythrocyte abnormalities developing after depletion; patients on therapy of more than one month should be considered for maintenance B12.
0	A malabsorption syndrome can develop in patients on aminosalicylic acid but is usually not complete.
1	The complete syndrome includes steatorrhea, an abnormal small bowel pattern on x-ray, villus atrophy, depressed cholesterol, reduced D-xylose and iron absorption.
0	Triglyceride absorption always is normal.
1	In one literature report 8 hours after the last dosage of aminosalicylic acid at 2 gm qid serum digoxin levels were reduced 40% in two of ten patients but not changed in the remaining eight.
0	All drugs should be stopped at the first sign suggesting a hypersensitivity reaction.
0	They may be restarted one at a time in very small but gradually increasing doses to determine whether the manifestations are drug-induced and, if so, which drug is responsible.
0	Desensitization has been accomplished successfully in 15 of 17 patients starting with 10 mg aminosalicylic acid given as a single dose.
0	The dosage is doubled every 2 days until reaching a total of 1 gram after which the dosage is divided to follow the regular schedule of administration.
0	If a mild temperature rise or skin reaction develops, the increment is to be dropped back one level or the progression held for one cycle.
0	Reactions are rare after a total dosage of 1.5 grams.
0	Patients with hepatic disease may not tolerate aminosalicylic acid as well as normal patients, even though the metabolism in patients with hepatic disease has been reported to be comparable to that in normal volunteers.
0	The patient should be advised that the first signs of hypersensitivity include a rash, often followed by fever, and much less frequently, GI disturbances of anorexia, nausea or diarrhea.
0	If such symptoms develop, the patient should immediately cease taking the medication and arrange for a prompt clinical visit.
0	Patients should be advised that poor compliance in taking anti-TB medication often leads to treatment failure, and, not infrequently, to the development of resistance of the organisms in the individual patient.
0	Patients should be advised that the skeleton of the granules may be seen in the stool.
0	The coating to protect the PASER granules dissolves promptly under neutral conditions; the granules therefore should be administered by sprinkling on acidic foods such as apple sauce or yogurt or by suspension in a fruit drink which will protect the coating, but the granules sink and will have to be swirled.
0	The coating will last at least 2 hours in either system.
0	All juices tested to date have been satisfactory; tested are: tomato, orange, grapefruit, grape, cranberry, apple, <U+201C>fruit punch<U+201D>.
0	Patients should be advised to store PASER in a refrigerator or freezer.
0	PASER packets may be stored at room temperature for short periods of time.
0	Patients should be advised NOT to use if the packets are swollen or the granules have lost their tan color and are dark brown or purple.
0	The patient should inform the pharmacist or physician immediately and return the medication.
0	Aminosalicylic acid has been reported to interfere technically with the serum determinations of albumin by dye-binding, SGOT by the azoene dye method and with qualitative urine tests for ketones, bilirubin, urobilinogen or porphobilinogen.
0	Sodium aminosalicylate produced an occipital bone defect, probably with a dose response, when administered to ten pregnant Wistar rats at five doses from 3.85 to 385 mg/kg from days 6 to 14.
0	There were no significant changes from controls in any group in corpora lutea, early resorptions, total resorptions, fetal death, litter size, or hematomas.
0	For all except the 77 mg/kg group, fetal weights were significantly greater than controls.
0	Chinchilla rabbits on 5 mg/kg from days 7 to 14 did not show any significant differences as compared to controls for the same parameters studied.
0	Sodium aminosalicylic acid was not mutagenic in Ames tester strain TA 100.
0	In human lymphocyte cultures in-vitro clastogenic effects of achromatic, chromatid, isochromatic breaks or chromatid translocations were not seen at 153 or 600 <U+03BC>g/mL.
0	At 1500 and 3000 <U+03BC>g/mL there was a dose related increase in chromatid aberrations.
0	Patients on isoniazid and aminosalicylic acid have been reported to have an increased number of chromosomal aberrations as compared to controls.
0	Aminosalicylic acid has been reported to produce occipital malformations in rats when given at doses within the human dose range.
0	Although there probably is a dose response, the frequency of abnormalities was comparable to controls at the highest level tested (two times the human dosage).
0	When administered to rabbits at 5 mg/kg, throughout all three trimesters, no teratologic or embryocidal effects were seen.
0	Literature reports on aminosalicylic acid in pregnant women always report coadministration of other medications.
0	Because there are no adequate and well controlled studies of aminosalicylic acid in humans, PASER granules should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
0	After administration of a different preparation of aminosalicylic acid to one patient, the maximum concentration in the milk was 1 <U+03BC>g/mL at 3 hours with a half-life of 2.5 hours; the maximum maternal plasma concentration was 70 <U+03BC>g/mL at two hours.
0	Liver Function In one retrospective study of 7492 patients on rapidly absorbed aminosalicylic acid preparations, drug-induced hepatitis occurred in 38 patients (0.5%); in these 38 the first symptom usually appeared within three months of the start of therapy with a rash as the most common event followed by fever and much less frequently by GI disturbances of anorexia, nausea or diarrhea.
0	Only one patient was diagnosed on routine biochemistry.
0	Premonitory symptoms in 90% of these 38 patients preceded jaundice by a few days to several weeks with the mean time of onset 33 days with a range of 7-90 days.
0	Half of the adverse reactions occurred during the third, fourth or fifth weeks.
0	When aminosalicylic acid-induced hepatitis was diagnosed, hepatomegaly was invariably present with lymphadenopathy in 46%, leucocytosis in 79%, and eosinophilia in 55%.
0	Prompt recognition with discontinuation led to the recovery of all 38 patients.
0	If recognized in the premonitory stage, the reaction is reported to <U+201C>settle<U+201D> in 24 hours and no jaundice ensues.
0	From other reported studies failure to recognize the reaction can result in a mortality of up to 21%.
0	The patient must be monitored carefully during the first three months of therapy and treatment must be discontinued immediately at the first sign of a rash, fever or other premonitory signs of intolerance.
0	Mechanism of Action: Aminosalicylic acid is bacteriostatic against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
0	It inhibits the onset of bacterial resistance to streptomycin and isoniazid.
0	The mechanism of action has been postulated to be inhibition of folic acid synthesis (but without potentiation with antifolic compounds) and/or inhibition of synthesis of the cell wall component, mycobactin, thus reducing iron uptake by M. tuberculosis.
0	Characteristics: The two major considerations in the clinical pharmacology of aminosalicylic acid are the prompt production of a toxic inactive metabolite under acid conditions and the short serum half life of one hour for the free drug.
0	After two hours in simulated gastric fluid, 10% of unprotected aminosalicylic acid is decarboxylated to form meta-aminophenol, a known hepatotoxin.
0	The acid-resistant coating of the PASER granules protects against degradation in the stomach.
0	The small granules are designed to escape the usual restriction on gastric emptying of large particles.
0	Under neutral conditions such as are found in the small intestine or in neutral foods, the acid-resistant coating is dissolved within one minute.
0	Care must be taken in the administration of these granules to protect the acid-resistant coating by maintaining the granules in an acidic food during dosage administration.
0	Patients who have neutralized gastric acid with antacids will not need to protect the acid resistant coating with an acidic food since no acid is present to spoil the drug.
0	Antacids may influence the absorption of other medications and are not necessary for PASER consumed with an acidic food.
0	Because PASER granules are protected by an enteric coating absorption does not commence until they leave the stomach; the soft skeletons of the granules remain and may be seen in the stool.
0	Absorption and excretion: In a single 4 gram pharmacokinetic study with food in normal volunteers the initial time to a 2<U+03BC>g/mL serum level of aminosalicylic acid was 2 hours with a range of 45 minutes to 24 hours; the median time to peak was 6 hours with a range of 1.5 to 24 hours; the mean peak level was 20 <U+03BC>g/mL with a range of 9 to 35 <U+03BC>g/mL; a level of 2 <U+03BC>g/mL was maintained for an average of 7.9 hours with a range of 5 to 9; a level of 1 <U+03BC>g/mL was maintained for an average of 8.8 hours with a range of 6 to 11.5 hours.
0	The recommended schedule is 4 grams every 8 hours.
0	80% of aminosalicylic acid is excreted in the urine, with 50% or more of the dosage excreted in acetylated form.
0	The acetylation process is not genetically determined as is the case for isoniazid.
0	Aminosalicylic acid is excreted by glomerular filtration; although previously reported otherwise, probenecid, a tubular blocking agent, does not enhance plasma concentration.
0	In a 1954 study thyroxine synthesis but not iodide uptake was reported reduced about 40% when the sodium salt (not PASER granules) of aminosalicylic acid was administered one hour before radio-iodine; the sodium salt typically produces a serum level over 120 <U+03BC>g/mL at one hour lasting one hour.
0	Occasional goiter development can be prevented by the administration of thyroxine but not iodide.
0	Penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid occurs only if the meminges are inflamed.
0	Approximately 50-60% of aminosalicylic acid is protein bound; binding is reported to be reduced 50% in kwashiorkor.
0	Microbiology: The aminosalicylic acid MIC for M. tuberculosis in 7H11 agar was less than 1.0 <U+03BC>g/mL for nine strains including three multidrug resistant strains, but 4 and 8 <U+03BC>g/mL for two other multidrug resistant strains.
0	The 90% inhibition in 7H12 broth (Bactec) showed little dose response but was interpreted as being less than or equal to 0.12-0.25 <U+03BC>g/mL for eight strains of which three were multi-resistant, 0.50 <U+03BC>g/mL for one resistant strain, questionable for four non-resistant strains and greater than 1<U+03BC>g/mL for one non-resistant and three resistant strains.
0	Aminosalicylic acid is not active in vitro against M. avium.
0	Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid therapy has been reported and may occur or may develop even after many months of treatment.
0	The risk of developing hepatitis is age related.
0	Approximate case rates by age are: less than 1 per 1,000 for persons under 20 years of age, 3 per 1,000 for persons in the 20 to 34 year age group, 12 per 1,000 for persons in the 35 to 49 year age group, 23 per 1,000 for persons in the 50 to 64 year age group, and 8 per 1,000 for persons over 65 years of age.
0	The risk of hepatitis is increased with daily consumption of alcohol.
0	Precise data to provide a fatality rate for isoniazid-related hepatitis is not available; however, in a U.S. Public Health Service Surveillance Study of 13,838 persons taking isoniazid, there were 8 deaths among 174 cases of hepatitis.
0	Therefore, patients given isoniazid should be carefully monitored and interviewed at monthly intervals.
0	For persons 35 and older, in addition to monthly symptom reviews, hepatic enzymes (specifically, AST and ALT (formerly SGOT and SGPT, respectively)) should be measured prior to starting isoniazid therapy and periodically throughout treatment.
0	Isoniazid-associated hepatitis usually occurs during the first three months of treatment.
0	Usually, enzyme levels return to normal despite continuance of drug, but in some cases progressive liver dysfunction occurs.
0	Other factors associated with an increased risk of hepatitis include daily use of alcohol, chronic liver disease and injection drug use.
0	A recent report suggests an increased risk of fatal hepatitis associated with isoniazid among women, particularly black and Hispanic women.
0	The risk may also be increased during the post partum period.
0	More careful monitoring should be considered in these groups, possibly including more frequent laboratory monitoring.
0	If abnormalities of liver function exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of isoniazid should be strongly considered.
0	Liver function tests are not a substitute for a clinical evaluation at monthly intervals or for the prompt assessment of signs or symptoms of adverse reactions occurring between regularly scheduled evaluations.
0	Patients should be instructed to immediately report signs or symptoms consistent with liver damage or other adverse effects.
0	These include any of the following: unexplained anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, icterus, rash, persistent paresthesias of the hands and feet, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration and/or abdominal tenderness, especially right upper quadrant discomfort.
0	If these symptoms appear or if signs suggestive of hepatic damage are detected, isoniazid should be discontinued promptly, since continued use of the drug in these cases has been reported to cause a more severe form of liver damage.
0	Patients with tuberculosis who have hepatitis attributed to isoniazid should be given appropriate treatment with alternative drugs.
0	If isoniazid must be reinstituted, it should be reinstituted only after symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have cleared.
0	The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent liver involvement.
0	Preventive treatment should be deferred in persons with acute hepatic diseases.
0	Isoniazid is contraindicated in patients who develop severe hypersensitivity reactions, including drug-induced hepatitis; previous isoniazid-associated hepatic injury; severe adverse reactions to isoniazid such as drug fever, chills, arthritis; and acute liver disease of any etiology.
0	NOTE: For preventive therapy of tuberculous infection and treatment of tuberculosis, it is recommended that physicians be familiar with the following publications: (1) the recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, published in the MMWR: vol 42; RR-4, 1993 and (2) Treatment of Tuberculosis and Tuberculosis Infection in Adults and Children, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine: vol 149; 1359-1374, 1994.
0	Isoniazid Injection USP is used in conjunction with other effective antituberculous agents.
0	Drug susceptibility testing should be performed on the organism initially isolated from all patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis.
0	If the bacilli becomes resistant, therapy must be changed to agents to which the bacilli are susceptible.
0	5 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 15 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week 10 to 15 mg/kg up to 300 mg daily in a single dose; or 20 to 40 mg/kg up to 900 mg/day, two or three times/week There are three regimen options for the initial treatment of tuberculosis in children and adults: Option 1: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks followed by 16 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin daily or 2 to 3 times weekly.
0	Ethambutol or streptomycin should be added to the initial regimen until sensitivity to isoniazid and rifampin is demonstrated.
0	The addition of a fourth drug is optional if the relative prevalence of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in the community is less than or equal to four percent.
0	Option 2: Daily isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and streptomycin or ethambutol for 2 weeks followed by twice weekly administration of the same drugs for 6 weeks, subsequently twice weekly isoniazid and rifampin for 16 weeks.
0	Option 3: Three times weekly with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol or streptomycin for 6 months.
0	*All regimens given twice weekly or 3 times weekly should be administered by directly observed therapy.
0	The above treatment guidelines apply only when the disease is caused by organisms that are susceptible to the standard antituberculous agents.
0	Because of the impact of resistance to isoniazid and rifampin on the response to therapy, it is essential that physicians initiating therapy for tuberculosis be familiar with the prevalence of drug resistance in their communities.
0	It is suggested that ethambutol not be used in children whose vital acuity cannot be monitored.
0	The response of the immunologically impaired host to treatment may not be satisfactory as that of a person with normal host responsiveness.
0	For this reason, therapeutic decisions for the impaired host must be individualized.
0	Since patients co-infected with HIV may have problems with malabsorption, screening of antimycobacterial drug levels, especially in patients with advanced HIV disease, may be necessary to prevent the emergence of MDRTB.
0	The basic principles that underlie the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis also apply to Extra pulmonary forms of the disease.
0	Although there have not been the same kinds of carefully conducted controlled trials of treatment of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis as for pulmonary disease, increasing clinical experience indicates that a 6 to 9 month short-course regimens are effective.
0	Because of the insufficient data, miliary tuberculosis, bone/joint tuberculosis, and tuberculosis meningitis in infants and children should receive 12 month therapy.
0	Bacteriologic evaluation of Extra pulmonary tuberculosis may be limited by the relative inaccessibility of the sites of disease.
0	Thus, response to treatment often must be judged on the basis of clinical and radiographic findings.
0	The use of adjunctive therapies such as surgery and corticosteroids is more commonly required in Extra pulmonary tuberculosis than in pulmonary disease.
0	Surgery may be necessary to obtain specimens for diagnosis and to treat such processes as constrictive pericarditis and spinal cord compression from Potts Disease.
0	Corticosteroids have been shown to be of benefit in preventing cardiac constriction from tuberculous pericarditis and in decreasing the neurologic sequelae of all stages of tuberculosis meningitis, especially when administered early in the course of the disease.
0	The options listed above must be adjusted for the pregnant patient.
0	Streptomycin interferes with in utero development of the ear and may cause congenital deafness.
0	Routine use of pyrazinamide is also not recommended in pregnancy because of inadequate teratogenicity data.
0	The initial treatment regimen should consist of isoniazid and rifampin.
0	Ethambutol should be included unless primary isoniazid resistance is unlikely (isoniazid resistance rate documented to be less than 4%).
0	Multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (i.e., resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) presents difficult treatment problems.
0	Treatment must be individualized and based on susceptibility studies.
0	In such cases, consultation with an expert in tuberculosis is recommended.
0	A major cause of drug-resistant tuberculosis is patient non-compliance with treatment.
0	The use of DOT can help assure patient compliance with drug therapy.
0	DOT is the observation of the patient by a health care provider or other responsible person as the patient ingests antituberculosis medications.
0	DOT can be achieved with daily, twice weekly or thrice weekly regimens, and is recommended for all patients.
0	Before isoniazid preventive therapy is initiated, bacteriologically positive or radiographically progressive tuberculosis must be excluded.
0	Appropriate evaluations should be performed if Extra pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected.
0	Adults over 30 Kg: 300 mg per day in a single dose.
0	Infants and Children: 10 mg/kg (up to 300 mg daily) in a single dose.
0	In situations where adherence with daily preventative therapy cannot be assured, 20 to 30 mg/kg (not to exceed 900 mg) twice weekly under the direct observation of a health care worker at the time of administration8.
0	Continuous administration of isoniazid for a sufficient period of time is an essential part of the regimen because relapse rates are higher if chemotherapy is stopped prematurely.
0	In the treatment of tuberculosis, resistant organisms may multiply and the emergence during the treatment may necessitate a change in the regimen.
0	For following patient compliance: the Potts-Cozart test9, a simple colorimetric6 method of checking for isoniazid in the urine, is a useful tool for assuring patient compliance, which is essential for effective tuberculosis control.
0	Additionally, isoniazid test strips are also available to check patient compliance.
0	Concomitant administration of pyridoxine (B6) is recommended in the malnourished and in those predisposed to neuropathy (e.g., alcoholics and diabetics).
0	Isoniazid should not be administered with food.
1	Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food.
0	Tyramine- and histamine-containing foods should be avoided in patients receiving isoniazid.
0	Because isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity, an interaction with tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) may occur.
0	Diamine oxidase may also be inhibited, causing exaggerated response (e.g., headache, sweating, palpitations, flushing, hypotension) to foods containing histamine (e.g., skipjack, tuna, other tropical fish).
0	A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving Isoniazid.
0	It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed.
0	However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P-450IIE1, a mixed-function oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver.
0	Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P-450IIE1 in the patients liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites.
0	Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in rats1,2.
1	Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels.
0	Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made3.
0	Potential interaction of Ketoconazole and Isoniazid may exist.
1	When Ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of Ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88% after 5 months of concurrent Isoniazid and Rifampin therapy4.
1	Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin.
1	To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made5,6.
1	A recent study has shown that concomitant administration of isoniazid and theophylline may cause elevated plasma levels of theophylline, and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of isoniazid.
0	Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely, and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made7.
1	A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of valproate when co-administered with isoniazid.
0	Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isoniazid and valproate are co-administered, and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made5.
0	All drugs should be stopped and an evaluation made at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction.
0	If isoniazid therapy must be reinstituted, the drug should be given only after symptoms have cleared.
0	The drug should be restarted in very small and gradually increasing doses and should be withdrawn immediately if there is any indication of recurrent hypersensitivity reaction.
0	Use of isoniazid should be carefully monitored in the following: 1.Daily users of alcohol.
0	Daily ingestion of alcohol may be associated with a higher incidence of + isoniazid hepatitis.
0	2.Patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction.
0	4.Concurrent use of any chronically administered medication.
0	5.History of previous discontinuation of isoniazid.
0	6.Existence of peripheral neuropathy or conditions predisposing to neuropathy.
0	9.Women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period.
0	Periodic ophthalmologic examinations during isoniazid therapy are recommended when visual symptoms occur.
0	Because there is a higher frequency of isoniazid associated hepatitis among certain patient groups, including Age >35, daily users of alcohol, chronic liver disease, injection drug use and women belonging to minority groups, particularly in the post-partum period, transaminase measurements should be obtained prior to starting and monthly during preventative therapy, or more frequently as needed.
0	If any of the values exceed three to five times the upper limit of normal, isoniazid should be temporarily discontinued and consideration given to restarting therapy.
0	Isoniazid has been shown to induce pulmonary tumors in a number of strains of mice.
0	Isoniazid has not been shown to be carcinogenic in humans.
0	(Note: a diagnosis of mesothelioma in a child with prenatal exposure to isoniazid and no other apparent risk factors has been reported).
0	Isoniazid has been found to be weakly mutagenic in strains TA 100 and TA 1535 of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay) without metabolic activation.
0	Isoniazid has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and rabbits when given orally during pregnancy.
0	Isoniazid was not teratogenic in reproduction studies in mice, rats, and rabbits.
0	There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
0	Isoniazid should be used as a treatment for active tuberculosis during pregnancy because the benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
0	The benefit of preventive therapy also should be weighed against a possible risk to the fetus.
0	Preventive therapy generally should be started after delivery to prevent putting the fetus at risk of exposure; the low levels of isoniazid in breast milk do not threaten the neonate.
0	Since isoniazid is known to cross the placental barrier, neonates of isoniazid-treated mothers should be carefully observed for any evidence of adverse effects.
0	The small concentrations of isoniazid in breast milk do not produce toxicity in the nursing newborn; therefore, breast feeding should not be discouraged.
0	However, because levels of isoniazid are so low in breast milk, they can not be relied upon for prophylaxis or therapy of nursing infants.
0	Isoniazid acts against actively growing tubercle bacilli.
0	Within one to two hours after oral administration, isoniazid produces peak blood levels which decline to 50 percent or less within six hours.
0	It diffuses readily into all body fluids (cerebrospinal, pleural, and ascitic), tissues, organs, and excreta (saliva, sputum, and feces).
0	The drug also passes through the placental barrier and into milk in concentrations comparable to those in the plasma.
0	From 50 to 70 percent of a dose of isoniazid is excreted in the urine in 24 hours.
0	Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrazination.
0	The rate of acetylation is genetically determined.
0	Approximately 50 percent of Blacks and Caucasians are slow acetylators and the rest are rapid acetylators; the majority of Eskimos and Orientals are rapid acetylators.
0	The rate of acetylation does not significantly alter the effectiveness of isoniazid therapy when dosage is administered daily.
0	However, slow acetylation may lead to higher blood levels of the drug and thus an increase in toxic reactions.
0	Pyridoxine (B6) deficiency is sometimes observed in adults with high doses of isoniazid and is considered probably due to its competition with pyridoxal phosphate for the enzyme apotryptophanase.
0	Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall.
0	At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intracellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms.
0	Isoniazid resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli develop rapidly when isoniazid monotherapy is administered.
0	Two standardized in vitro susceptibility methods are available for testing isoniazid against Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms.
0	The agar proportion method (CDC or NCCLS M24-P) utilizes middlebrook 7H10 medium impregnated with isoniazid at two final concentrations, 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL.
0	MIC99 values are calculated by comparing the quantity of organisms growing in the medium containing drug to the control cultures.
0	Mycobacterial growth in the presence of drug <U+2265>1% of the control indicates resistance.
0	The radiometric broth method employs the BACTEC 460 machine to compare the growth index from untreated control cultures to cultures grown in the presence of 0.2 and 1.0 mcg/mL of isoniazid.
0	Strict adherence to the manufacturers instructions for sample processing and data interpretation is required for this assay.
0	Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with an MIC99 <U+2264>0.2 mcg/mL are considered to be susceptible to isoniazid.
0	Susceptibility test results obtained by the two different methods discussed above cannot be compared unless equivalent drug concentrations are evaluated.
0	The clinical relevance of in vitro susceptibility for mycobacterium species other than M. tuberculosis using either the BACTEC or the proportion method has not been determined.
0	SYSTEMIC ABSORPTION OF NEOMYCIN OCCURS FOLLOWING ORAL ADMINISTRATION AND TOXIC REACTIONS MAY OCCUR.
0	Patients treated with neomycin should be under close clinical observation because of the potential toxicity associated with their use.
0	NEUROTOXICITY (INCLUDING OTOTOXICITY) AND NEPHROTOXICITY FOLLOWING THE ORAL USE OF NEOMYCIN SULFATE HAVE BEEN REPORTED, EVEN WHEN USED IN RECOMMENDED DOSES.
0	THE POTENTIAL FOR NEPHROTOXICITY, PERMANENT BILATERAL AUDITORY OTOTOXICITY AND SOMETIMES VESTIBULAR TOXICITY IS PRESENT IN PATIENTS WITH NORMAL RENAL FUNCTION WHEN TREATED WITH HIGHER DOSES OF NEOMYCIN AND/OR FOR LONGER PERIODS THAN RECOMMENDED.
0	Serial, vestibular and audiometric tests, as well as tests of renal function, should be performed (especially in high-risk patients).
0	THE RISK OF NEPHROTOXICITY AND OTOTOXICITY IS GREATER IN PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION.
0	Ototoxicity is often delayed in onset and patients developing cochlear damage will not have symptoms during therapy to warn them of developing eighth nerve destruction and total or partial deafness may occur long after neomycin has been discontinued.
0	Neuromuscular blockage and respiratory paralysis have been reported following the oral use of neomycin.
0	The possibility of the occurrence of neuromuscular blockage and respiratory paralysis should be considered if neomycin is administered, especially to patients receiving anesthetics, neuromuscular blocking agents such as tubocurarine, succinylcholine, decamethonium, or in patients receiving massive transfusions of citrate anticoagulated blood.
0	If blockage occurs, calcium salts may reverse these phenomena but mechanical respiratory assistance may be necessary.
0	Concurrent and/or sequential systemic, oral or topical use of other aminoglycosides, including paromomycin and other potentially nephrotoxic and/or neurotoxic drugs such as bacitracin, cisplatin, vancomycin, amphotericin B, polymyxin B, colistin and viomycin, should be avoided because the toxicity may be additive.
0	Other factors which increase the risk of toxicity are advanced age and dehydration.
0	The concurrent use of neomycin with potent diuretics such as ethacrynic acid or furosemide should be avoided, since certain diuretics by themselves may cause ototoxicity.
1	In addition, when administered intravenously, diuretics may enhance neomycin toxicity by altering the antibiotic concentration in serum and tissue.
0	Neomycin sulfate oral preparations are contraindicated in the presence of intestinal obstruction and in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug.
0	Patients with a history of hypersensitivity or serious toxic reaction to other aminoglycosides may have a cross-sensitivity to neomycin.
0	Neomycin sulfate oral preparations are contraindicated in patients with inflammatory or ulcerative gastrointestinal disease because of the potential for enhanced gastrointestinal absorption of neomycin.
0	To minimize the risk of toxicity, use the lowest possible dose and the shortest possible treatment period to control the condition.
0	Treatment for periods longer than two weeks is not recommended.
0	For use as an adjunct in the management of hepatic coma, the recommended dose is 4 to 12 grams per day given in the following regimen: Withdraw protein from diet.
0	Give supportive therapy, including blood products, as indicated.
0	Give neomycin sulfate tablets in doses of 4 to 12 grams of neomycin sulfate per day (eight to 24 tablets) in divided doses.
0	Treatment should be continued over a period of five to six days, during which time protein should be returned incrementally to the diet.
0	If less potentially toxic drugs cannot be used for chronic hepatic insufficiency, neomycin in doses of up to four grams daily (eight tablets per day) may be necessary.
0	The risk for the development of neomycin-induced toxicity progressively increases when treatment must be extended to preserve the life of a patient with hepatic encephalopathy who has failed to fully respond.
0	Frequent periodic monitoring of these patients to ascertain the presence of drug toxicity is mandatory.
0	Also, neomycin serum concentrations should be monitored to avoid potentially toxic levels.
0	The benefits to the patient should be weighed against the risks of nephrotoxicity, permanent ototoxicity and neuromuscular blockade following the accumulation of neomycin in the tissues.
0	Listed below is an example of a recommended bowel preparation regimen.
0	A proposed surgery time of 8:00 a.m. has been used.
0	Pre-op Day 3: Minimum residue or clear liquid diet.
0	Bisacodyl, 1 tablet orally at 6:00 p.m. Pre-op Day 2: Minimum residue or clear liquid diet.
0	Magnesium sulfate, 30 mL, 50% solution (15 g) orally at 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Enema at 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Pre-op Day 1: Clear liquid diet.
0	Magnesium sulfate, 30 mL, 50% solution (15 g) orally at 10:00 a.m., and 2:00 p.m. Neomycin sulfate (1 g) and erythromycin base (1 g) orally at 1:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. No enema.
0	Day of Operation: Patient evacuates rectum at 6:30 a.m. for scheduled operation at 8:00 a.m.
0	Caution should be taken in concurrent or serial use of other neurotoxic and/or nephrotoxic drugs because of possible enhancement of the nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity of neomycin.
0	Caution should also be taken in concurrent or serial use of other amino-glycosides and polymyxins because they may enhance neomycin<U+2019>s nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity and potentiate neomycin sulfate<U+2019>s neuromuscular blocking effects.
1	Oral neomycin inhibits the gastrointestinal absorption of penicillin V, oral vitamin B-12, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil.
1	The gastrointestinal absorption of digoxin also appears to be inhibited.
0	Therefore, digoxin serum levels should be monitored.
0	Oral neomycin sulfate may enhance the effect of coumarin in anticoagulants by decreasing vitamin K availability.
0	Prescribing Neomycin Sulfate Tablets USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.
0	As with other antibiotics, use of oral neomycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, particularly fungi.
0	If this occurs, appropriate therapy should be instituted.
0	Neomycin is quickly and almost totally absorbed from body surfaces (except the urinary bladder) after local irrigation and when applied topically in association with surgical procedures.
0	Delayed-onset irreversible deafness, renal failure and death due to neuromuscular blockade (regardless of the status of renal function) have been reported following irrigation of both small and large surgical fields with minute quantities of neomycin.
0	Cross-allergenicity among amino-glycosides has been demonstrated.
0	Aminoglycosides should be used with caution in patients with muscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or parkinsonism since these drugs may aggravate muscle weakness because of their potential curare-like effect on the neuromuscular junction.
0	Small amounts of orally administered neomycin are absorbed through intact intestinal mucosa.
0	There have been many reports in the literature of nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity with oral use of neomycin.
0	If renal insufficiency develops during oral therapy, consideration should be given to reducing the drug dosage or discontinuing therapy.
0	An oral neomycin dose of 12 grams per day produces a malabsorption syndrome for a variety of substances, including fat, nitrogen, cholesterol, carotene, glucose, xylose, lactose, sodium, calcium, cyanocobalamin and iron.
0	Orally administered neomycin increases fecal bile acid excretion and reduces intestinal lactase activity.
0	Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Neomycin Sulfate Tablets USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections.
0	They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold).
0	When Neomycin Sulfate Tablets USP are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.
0	Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Neomycin Sulfate Tablets USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future.
0	Before administering the drug, patients or members of their families should be informed of possible toxic effects on the eighth nerve.
0	The possibility of acute toxicity increases in premature infants and neonates.
0	Patients with renal insufficiency may develop toxic neomycin blood levels unless doses are properly regulated.
0	If renal insufficiency develops during treatment, the dosage should be reduced or the antibiotic discontinued.
0	To avoid nephrotoxicity and eighth nerve damage associated with high doses and prolonged treatment, the following should be performed prior to and periodically during therapy: urinalysis for increased excretion of protein, decreased specific gravity, casts and cells; renal function tests such as serum creatinine, BUN or creatinine clearance; tests of the vestibulocochlearis nerve (eighth cranial nerve) function.
0	Serial, vestibular and audiometric tests should be performed (especially in high-risk patients).
0	Since elderly patients may have reduced renal function which may not be evident in the results of routine screening tests such as BUN or serum creatinine, a creatinine clearance determination may be more useful.
0	No long-term animal studies have been performed with neomycin sulfate to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of fertility.
0	It is not known whether neomycin is excreted in human milk, but it has been shown to be excreted in cow milk following a single intramuscular injection.
0	Other aminoglycosides have been shown to be excreted in human milk.
0	Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from the aminoglycosides in nursing infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
0	The safety and efficacy of oral neomycin sulfate in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established.
0	If treatment of a patient less than 18 years of age is necessary, neomycin should be used with caution and the period of treatment should not exceed two weeks because of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
0	Additional manifestations of neurotoxicity may include numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching and convulsions.
0	The risk of hearing loss continues after drug withdrawal.
0	Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
0	Aminoglycoside antibiotics cross the placenta and there have been several reports of total irreversible bilateral congenital deafness in children whose mothers received streptomycin during pregnancy.
0	Although serious side effects to fetus or newborn have not been reported in the treatment of pregnant women with other aminoglycosides, the potential for harm exists.
0	Animal reproduction studies of neomycin have not been conducted.
0	If neomycin is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
0	Neomycin sulfate is poorly absorbed from the normal gastrointestinal tract.
0	The small absorbed fraction is rapidly distributed in the tissues and is excreted by the kidney in keeping with the degree of kidney function.
0	The unabsorbed portion of the drug (approximately 97%) is eliminated unchanged in the feces.
0	Growth of most intestinal bacteria is rapidly suppressed following oral administration of neomycin sulfate, with the suppression persisting for 48 to 72 hours.
0	Nonpathogenic yeasts and occasionally resistant strains of Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Aerobacter aerogenes) replace the intestinal bacteria.
0	As with other aminoglycosides, the amount of systemically absorbed neomycin transferred to the tissues increases cumulatively with each repeated dose administered until a steady state is achieved.
0	The kidney functions as the primary excretory path as well as the tissue binding site, with the highest concentration found in the renal cortex.
0	With repeated dosings, progressive accumulation also occurs in the inner ear.
0	Release of tissue-bound neomycin occurs slowly over a period of several weeks after dosing has been discontinued.
0	Protein binding studies have shown that the degree of aminoglycoside protein binding is low and, depending upon the methods used for testing, this may be between 0% and 30%.
0	In vitro tests have demonstrated that neomycin is bactericidal and acts by inhibiting the synthesis of protein in susceptible bacterial cells.
0	It is effective primarily against gram-negative bacilli but does have some activity against gram-positive organisms.
0	Neomycin is active in vitro against Escherichia coli and the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group.
0	Neomycin is not active against anaerobic bowel flora.
0	Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC.
0	There was a greater incidence of myocardial infarction in alvimopan-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients in a 12-month clinical trial, although a causal relationship has not been established.
0	In short-term trials with ENTEREG<U+00AE>, no increased risk of myocardial infarction was observed.
0	Because of the potential risk of myocardial infarction with long-term use, ENTEREG is available only through a restricted program for short-term use (15 doses) under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ENTEREG Access Support and Education (E.A.S.E.<U+00AE>) Program.
0	WARNING: POTENTIAL RISK OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION WITH LONG-TERM USE: FOR SHORT-TERM HOSPITAL USE ONLY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.
0	Increased incidence of myocardial infarction was seen in a clinical trial of patients taking alvimopan for long-term use.
0	ENTEREG is available only through a restricted program for short-term use (15 doses) called the ENTEREG Access Support and Education (E.A.S.E.<U+00AE>) Program.
0	ENTEREG is contraindicated in patients who have taken therapeutic doses of opioids for more than 7 consecutive days immediately prior to taking ENTEREG.

0	Patients should not receive more than 15 doses of ENTEREG.
0	12 mg administered 30 minutes to 5 hours prior to surgery followed by 12 mg twice daily beginning the day after surgery for up to 7 days for a maximum of 15 in-hospital doses.
0	An in vitro study indicates that alvimopan is not a substrate of CYP enzymes.
0	Therefore, concomitant administration of ENTEREG with inducers or inhibitors of CYP enzymes is unlikely to alter the metabolism of alvimopan.
0	Based on in vitro data, ENTEREG is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs through inhibition of CYP isoforms such as 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 2D6, and 2E1 or induction of CYP isoforms such as 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4.
0	In vitro, ENTEREG did not inhibit p-glycoprotein.
0	Coadministration of alvimopan does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of morphine and its metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide, to a clinically significant degree when morphine is administered intravenously.
0	Dosage adjustment for intravenously administered morphine is not necessary when it is coadministered with alvimopan.
0	A population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that the pharmacokinetics of alvimopan were not affected by concomitant administration of acid blockers or antibiotics.
0	No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients taking acid blockers or antibiotics.
0	A higher number of myocardial infarctions was reported in patients treated with alvimopan 0.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo in a 12-month study in patients treated with opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, although a causal relationship with long-term use has not been established.
0	Patients recently exposed to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of ENTEREG and therefore may experience abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea.
0	Not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
0	Not recommended in patients with end-stage renal disease.
0	Not recommended in patients with complete gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients who have surgery for correction of complete bowel obstruction.
0	Not recommended in pancreatic or gastric anastomosis.
0	There were more reports of myocardial infarctions in patients treated with alvimopan 0.5 mg twice daily compared with placebo-treated patients in a 12-month study of patients treated with opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (alvimopan 0.5 mg, n = 538; placebo, n = 267).
0	In this study, the majority of myocardial infarctions occurred between 1 and 4 months after initiation of treatment.
0	This imbalance has not been observed in other studies of ENTEREG in patients treated with opioids for chronic pain, nor in patients treated within the surgical setting, including patients undergoing surgeries that included bowel resection who received ENTEREG 12 mg twice daily for up to 7 days (the indicated dose and patient population; ENTEREG 12 mg, n = 1,142; placebo, n = 1,120).
0	A causal relationship with alvimopan with long-term use has not been established.
0	ENTEREG is available only through a program under a REMS that restricts use to enrolled hospitals.
0	ENTEREG is available only through a program called the ENTEREG Access Support and Education (E.A.S.E.)
0	ENTEREG REMS Program that restricts use to enrolled hospitals because of the potential risk of myocardial infarction with long-term use of ENTEREG.
0	Program include the following: ENTEREG is available only for short-term (15 doses) use in hospitalized patients.
0	Only hospitals that have enrolled in and met all of the requirements for the E.A.S.E. program may use ENTEREG.
0	Program, an authorized hospital representative must acknowledge that: hospital staff who prescribe, dispense, or administer ENTEREG have been provided the educational materials on the need to limit use of ENTEREG to short-term, inpatient use; patients will not receive more than 15 doses of ENTEREG; and ENTEREG will not be dispensed to patients after they have been discharged from the hospital.
0	Further information is available at www.ENTEREGREMS.com or 1-800-278-0340.
0	Patients recently exposed to opioids are expected to be more sensitive to the effects of <U+03BC>-opioid receptor antagonists, such as ENTEREG.
0	Since ENTEREG acts peripherally, clinical signs and symptoms of increased sensitivity would be related to the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea).
0	Patients receiving more than 3 doses of an opioid within the week prior to surgery were not studied in the postoperative ileus clinical trials.
0	Therefore, if ENTEREG is administered to these patients, they should be monitored for gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
0	Patients with severe hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of serious adverse reactions (including dose-related serious adverse reactions) because up to 10-fold higher plasma levels of drug have been observed in such patients compared with patients with normal hepatic function.
0	Therefore, the use of ENTEREG is not recommended in this population.
0	No studies have been conducted in patients with end-stage renal disease.
0	ENTEREG is not recommended for use in these patients.
0	No studies have been conducted in patients with complete gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients who have surgery for correction of complete bowel obstruction.
0	ENTEREG has not been studied in patients having pancreatic or gastric anastomosis.
0	Therefore, ENTEREG is not recommended for use in these patients.
0	Alvimopan is a selective antagonist of the cloned human <U+03BC>-opioid receptor with a Ki of 0.4 nM (0.2 ng/mL) and no measurable opioid-agonist effects in standard pharmacologic assays.
0	The dissociation of [3H]-alvimopan from the human <U+03BC>-opioid receptor is slower than that of other opioid ligands, consistent with its higher affinity for the receptor.
0	At concentrations of 1 to 10 <U+00B5>M, alvimopan demonstrated no activity at any of over 70 non-opioid receptors, enzymes, and ion channels.
0	Postoperative ileus is the impairment of gastrointestinal motility after intra-abdominal surgery or other, non-abdominal surgeries.
0	Postoperative ileus affects all segments of the gastrointestinal tract and may last from 5 to 6 days, or even longer.
0	This may potentially delay gastrointestinal recovery and hospital discharge until its resolution.
0	It is characterized by abdominal distention and bloating, nausea, vomiting, pain, accumulation of gas and fluids in the bowel, and delayed passage of flatus and defecation.
0	Postoperative ileus is the result of a multifactorial process that includes inhibitory sympathetic input and release of hormones, neurotransmitters, and other mediators (e.g., endogenous opioids).
0	A component of postoperative ileus also results from an inflammatory reaction and the effects of opioid analgesics.
0	Morphine and other <U+03BC>-opioid receptor agonists are universally used for the treatment of acute postsurgical pain; however, they are known to have an inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility and may prolong the duration of postoperative ileus.
0	Following oral administration, alvimopan antagonizes the peripheral effects of opioids on gastrointestinal motility and secretion by competitively binding to gastrointestinal tract <U+03BC>-opioid receptors.
0	The antagonism produced by alvimopan at opioid receptors is evident in isolated guinea pig ileum preparations in which alvimopan competitively antagonizes the effects of morphine on contractility.
0	Alvimopan achieves this selective gastrointestinal opioid antagonism without reversing the central analgesic effects of <U+03BC>-opioid agonists.
0	In an exploratory study in healthy volunteers, alvimopan 12 mg administered twice a day reduced the delay in small and large bowel transit induced by codeine 30 mg administered 4 times a day, as measured by gastrointestinal scintigraphy.
0	In the same study, concomitant alvimopan did not reduce the delay in gastric emptying induced by codeine.
0	In a study designed to evaluate potential effects on cardiac conduction, alvimopan did not cause clinically significant QTc prolongation at doses up to 24 mg twice daily (twice the approved dosage regimen) for 7 days.
0	The potential for QTc effects at higher doses has not been studied.
0	Following oral administration of alvimopan, an amide hydrolysis compound is present in the systemic circulation, which is considered a product exclusively of intestinal flora metabolism.
0	This compound is referred to as the 'metabolite'.
0	It is also a <U+03BC>-opioid receptor antagonist with a Ki of 0.8 nM (0.3 ng/mL).
0	Absorption: Following oral administration of ENTEREG capsules in healthy volunteers, plasma alvimopan concentration peaked at approximately 2 hours postdose.
0	No significant accumulation in alvimopan concentration was observed following twice daily (BID) dosing.
0	The mean peak plasma concentration was 10.98 (<U+00B1>6.43) ng/mL and mean AUC0<U+2013>12h was 40.2 (<U+00B1>22.5) ng<U+2219>h/mL after dosing of alvimopan at 12 mg BID for 5 days.
0	The absolute bioavailability was estimated to be 6% (range, 1% to 19%).
0	There was a delay in the appearance of the 'metabolite', which had a median Tmax of 36 hours following administration of a single dose of alvimopan.
0	Concentrations of the 'metabolite' were highly variable between subjects and within a subject.
0	The 'metabolite' accumulated after multiple doses of ENTEREG.
0	The mean Cmax for the 'metabolite' after alvimopan 12 mg twice daily for 5 days was 35.73 <U+00B1> 35.29 ng/mL.
0	Concentrations of alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are higher (~1.9-fold and ~1.4-fold, respectively) in postoperative ileus patients than in healthy volunteers.
1	Food Effects: A high-fat meal decreased the extent and rate of alvimopan absorption.
0	The Cmax and AUC were decreased by approximately 38% and 21%, respectively, and the Tmax was prolonged by approximately 1 hour.
0	The clinical significance of this decreased bioavailability is unknown.
0	In postoperative ileus clinical trials, the preoperative dose of ENTEREG was administered in a fasting state.
0	Subsequent doses were given without regard to meals.
0	Distribution: The steady-state volume of distribution of alvimopan was estimated to be 30<U+00B1>10 L. Plasma protein binding of alvimopan and its 'metabolite' was independent of concentration over ranges observed clinically and averaged 80% and 94%, respectively.
0	Both alvimopan and the 'metabolite' were bound to albumin and not to alpha-1 acid glycoprotein.
0	Metabolism and Elimination: In vitro data suggest that alvimopan is not a substrate of CYP enzymes.
0	The average plasma clearance for alvimopan was 402 (<U+00B1>89) mL/min.
0	Renal excretion accounted for approximately 35% of total clearance.
0	There was no evidence that hepatic metabolism was a significant route for alvimopan elimination.
0	Biliary secretion was considered the primary pathway for alvimopan elimination.
0	Unabsorbed drug and unchanged alvimopan resulting from biliary excretion were then hydrolyzed to its 'metabolite' by gut microflora.
0	The 'metabolite' was eliminated in the feces and in the urine as unchanged 'metabolite', the glucuronide conjugate of the 'metabolite', and other minor metabolites.
0	The mean terminal phase half-life of alvimopan after multiple oral doses of ENTEREG ranged from 10 to 17 hours.
0	The terminal half-life of the 'metabolite' ranged from 10 to 18 hours.
0	Specific Populations: Age: The pharmacokinetics of alvimopan, but not its 'metabolite', were related to age, but this effect was not clinically significant and does not warrant dosage adjustment based on increased age.
0	Race: The pharmacokinetic characteristics of alvimopan were not affected by Hispanic or Black race.
0	Plasma 'metabolite' concentrations were lower in Black and Hispanic patients (by 43% and 82%, respectively) than in Caucasian patients following alvimopan administration.
0	These changes are not considered to be clinically significant in surgical patients.
0	Japanese healthy male volunteers had an approximately 2-fold increase in plasma alvimopan concentrations, but no change in 'metabolite' pharmacokinetics.
0	The pharmacokinetics of alvimopan have not been studied in subjects of other East Asian ancestry.
0	Dosage adjustment in Japanese patients is not required.
0	Gender: There was no effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of alvimopan or the 'metabolite'.
0	Hepatic Impairment: Exposure to alvimopan following a single 12 mg dose tended to be higher (1.5- to 2-fold, on average) in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (as defined by Child-Pugh Class A and B, n = 8 each) compared with healthy controls (n = 4).
0	There were no consistent effects on the Cmax or half-life of alvimopan in patients with hepatic impairment.
0	However, 2 of 16 patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment had longer than expected half-lives of alvimopan, indicating that some accumulation may occur upon multiple dosing.
0	The Cmax of the 'metabolite' tended to be more variable in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment than in matched normal subjects.
0	A study of 3 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), indicated similar alvimopan exposure in 2 patients and an approximately 10-fold increase in Cmax and exposure in 1 patient with severe hepatic impairment when compared with healthy control volunteers.
0	Renal Impairment: There was no relationship between renal function (i.e., creatinine clearance [CrCl]) and plasma alvimopan pharmacokinetics (Cmax, AUC, or half-life) in patients with mild (CrCl 51<U+2013>80 mL/min), moderate (CrCl 31<U+2013>50 mL/min), or severe (CrCl <30 mL/min) renal impairment (n = 6 each).
0	Renal clearance of alvimopan was related to renal function; however, because renal clearance was only a small fraction (35%) of the total clearance, renal impairment had a small effect on the apparent oral clearance of alvimopan.
0	The half-lives of alvimopan were comparable in the mild, moderate, and control renal impairment groups but longer in the severe renal impairment group.
0	Exposure to the 'metabolite' tended to be 2- to 5-fold higher in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment compared with patients with mild renal impairment or control subjects.
0	Thus, there may be accumulation of alvimopan and 'metabolite' in patients with severe renal impairment receiving multiple doses of ENTEREG.
0	Patients with end-stage renal disease were not studied.
0	Crohn's Disease: There was no relationship between disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease (measured as Crohn's Disease Activity Index or bowel movement frequency) and alvimopan pharmacokinetics (AUC or Cmax).
0	Patients with active or quiescent Crohn's disease had increased variability in alvimopan pharmacokinetics, and exposure tended to be 2-fold higher in patients with quiescent disease than in those with active disease or in normal subjects.
0	Concentrations of the 'metabolite' were lower in patients with Crohn's disease.
0	Drug Interactions: Potential for Drugs to Affect Alvimopan Pharmacokinetics: Concomitant administration of ENTEREG with inducers or inhibitors of CYP enzymes is unlikely to alter the metabolism of alvimopan because ENTEREG is metabolized mainly by non-CYP enzyme pathway.
0	No clinical studies have been performed to assess the effect of concomitant administration of inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes on alvimopan pharmacokinetics.
0	In vitro studies suggest that alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are substrates for p-glycoprotein.
0	A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not reveal any evidence that alvimopan or 'metabolite' pharmacokinetics were influenced by concomitant medications that are mild-to-moderate p-glycoprotein inhibitors.
0	No clinical studies of concomitant administration of alvimopan and strong inhibitors of p-glycoprotein (e.g., verapamil, cyclosporine, amiodarone, itraconazole, quinine, spironolactone, quinidine, diltiazem, bepridil) have been conducted.
0	However, plasma concentrations of the 'metabolite' were lower in patients receiving acid blockers or preoperative oral antibiotics (49% and 81%, respectively).
0	No dosage adjustments are necessary in these patients.
0	Potential for Alvimopan to Affect the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs: Alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are not inhibitors of CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, 2D6, and 2E1 in vitro at concentrations far in excess of those observed clinically.
0	Alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are not inducers of CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4.
0	In vitro studies also suggest that alvimopan and its 'metabolite' are not inhibitors of p-glycoprotein.
0	These in vitro findings suggest that ENTEREG is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs through inhibition or induction of CYP enzymes or inhibition of p-glycoprotein.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components in the preparation.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% may be used in adult and pediatric patients 3 months of age or older.

0	The safety and efficacy of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% in pediatric patients below 3 months of age have not been established.
0	Apply a thin film of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% to the affected skin areas once or twice daily.
0	Apply a thin film of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% to the affected skin areas twice daily.
0	As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved.
0	If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, reassessment of diagnosis may be necessary.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be used with occlusive dressings.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be applied in the diaper area, as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressings.
0	In studies where geriatric patients (65 years of age or older, see PRECAUTIONS ) have been treated with fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05%, safety did not differ from that in younger patients; therefore, no dosage adjustment is recommended.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product.
0	Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to formaldehyde as it may prevent healing or worsen dermatitis.
0	Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal from treatment.
0	Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment.
0	Patients applying a potent topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression.
0	This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests.
0	If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid.
0	Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.
0	Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids.
0	For information on systemic supplementation, see prescribing information for those products.
0	Fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05% caused depression of A.M. plasma cortisol levels in 1 of 6 adult patients when used daily for 7 days in patients with psoriasis or eczema involving at least 30% of the body surface.
0	After 2 days of treatment, this patient developed a 60% decrease from pretreatment values in the A.M. plasma cortisol level.
0	There was some evidence of corresponding decrease in the 24-hour urinary free cortisol levels.
0	The A.M. plasma cortisol level remained slightly depressed for 48 hours but recovered by day 6 of treatment.
0	Fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05%, caused HPA axis suppression in 2 of 43 pediatric patients, ages 2 and 5 years old, who were treated for 4 weeks covering at least 35% of the body surface area.
0	Follow-up testing 12 days after treatment discontinuation, available for 1 of the 2 subjects, demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis.
0	Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios.
0	The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids, and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids.
0	These reactions are listed in an approximately decreasing order of occurrence: irritation, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infections, skin atrophy, striae, hypertrichosis, and miliaria.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% may cause local cutaneous adverse reactions.
0	If irritation develops, Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.
0	Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids.
0	Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing.
0	If concomitant skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used.
0	If a favorable response does not occur promptly, use of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be used in the presence of preexisting skin atrophy and should not be used where infection is present at the treatment site.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be used in the treatment of rosacea and perioral dermatitis.
0	Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions: 1.This medication is to be used as directed by the physician.
0	2.This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed.
0	3.The treated skin area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician.
0	4.Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions as well as non-healing or worsening of skin condition.
0	5.Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use this medication in the treatment of diaper dermatitis.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should not be applied in the diaper areas as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing.
0	6.This medication should not be used on the face, underarms, or groin areas unless directed by a physician.
0	7.As with other corticosteroids, therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved.
0	If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact the physician.
0	8.Patients should report to their physician if they are allergic to formaldehyde.
0	The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression: ACTH stimulation test A.M. plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Two 18-month studies were performed in mice to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fluticasone propionate when given topically (as an 0.05% ointment) and orally.
0	No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in either study.
0	Fluticasone propionate was not mutagenic in the standard Ames test, E. coli fluctuation test, S. cerevisiae gene conversion test, or Chinese Hamster ovarian cell assay.
0	It was not clastogenic in mouse micronucleus or cultured human lymphocyte tests.
0	In a fertility and general reproductive performance study in rats, fluticasone propionate administered subcutaneously to females at up to 50 mcg/kg per day and to males at up to 100 mcg/kg per day (later reduced to 50 mcg/kg per day) had no effect upon mating performance or fertility.
0	These doses are approximately 15 and 30 times, respectively, the human systemic exposure following use of the recommended human topical dose of fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05%, assuming human percutaneous absorption of approximately 3% and the use in a 70-kg person of 15 g/day.
0	Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels.
0	Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals.
0	Teratology studies in the mouse demonstrated fluticasone propionate to be teratogenic (cleft palate) when administered subcutaneously in doses of 45 mcg/kg/day and 150 mcg/kg/day.
0	This dose is approximately 14 and 45 times, respectively, the human topical dose of fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05%.
0	There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05%, should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
0	Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects.
0	It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk.
0	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% is administered to a nursing woman.
0	Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% should be discontinued if control is achieved before 4 weeks.
0	If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks, contact a physician.
0	The safety and efficacy of drug use for longer than 4 weeks in this population have not been established.
0	Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use this medication in the treatment of diaper dermatitis unless directed by the physician.
0	Fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05% caused HPA axis suppression in 2 of 43 pediatric patients, ages 2 and 5 years old, who were treated for 4 weeks covering at least 35% of the body surface area.
0	Adverse effects including striae have been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients.
0	HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids.
0	Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include low plasma cortisol levels to an absence of response to ACTH stimulation.
0	Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.
0	Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen.
0	Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children.
0	A limited number of patients above 65 years of age (n=126) have been treated with fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05% in US and non-US clinical trials.
0	While the number of patients is too small to permit separate analysis of efficacy and safety, the adverse reactions reported in this population were similar to those reported by younger patients.
0	Based on available data, no adjustment of dosage of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% in geriatric patients is warranted.
0	Like other topical corticosteroids, fluticasone propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties.
0	The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear.
0	However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins.
0	It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid.
0	Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.
0	Fluticasone propionate is lipophilic and has a strong affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor.
0	It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor, and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid, estrogen, or androgen receptors.
0	The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half-life of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex.
0	The half-life of the fluticasone propionate-glucocorticoid receptor complex is approximately 10 hours.
0	Studies performed with fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05% indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.
0	The activity of Fluticasone Propionate Cream, 0.05% is due to the parent drug, fluticasone propionate.
0	The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier.
0	Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin.
0	Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption.
0	In a human study of 12 healthy males receiving 12.5 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream twice daily for 3 weeks, plasma levels were generally below the level of quantification (0.05 ng/mL).
0	In another study of 6 healthy males administered 25 g of 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream under occlusion for 5 days, plasma levels of fluticasone ranged from 0.07 to 0.39 ng/mL.
0	In an animal study using radiolabeled 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream and ointment preparations, rats received a topical dose of 1 g/kg for a 24-hour period.
0	Total recovery of radioactivity was approximately 80% at the end of 7 days.
0	The majority of the dose (73%) was recovered from the surface of the application site.
0	Less than 1% of the dose was recovered in the skin at the application site.
0	Approximately 5% of the dose was absorbed systemically through the skin.
0	Absorption from the skin continued for the duration of the study (7 days), indicating a long retention time at the application site.
0	Following intravenous administration of 1 mg fluticasone propionate in healthy volunteers, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding.
0	The apparent volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg (range, 2.3 to 16.7 L/kg).
0	The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91%.
0	Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes.
0	Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin.
0	No metabolites of fluticasone propionate were detected in an in vitro study of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate incubated in a human skin homogenate.
0	The total blood clearance of systemically absorbed fluticasone propionate averages 1,093 mL/min (range, 618 to 1,702 mL/min) after a 1-mg intravenous dose, with renal clearance accounting for less than 0.02% of the total.
0	Fluticasone propionate is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated hydrolysis of the 5-fluoromethyl carbothioate grouping.
0	This transformation occurs in 1 metabolic step to produce the inactive 17-<U+03B2>-carboxylic acid metabolite, the only known metabolite detected in man.
0	This metabolite has approximately 2,000 times less affinity than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies.
0	Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man.
0	Following intravenous dose of 1 mg in healthy volunteers, fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had an average terminal half-life of 7.2 hours (range, 3.2 to 11.2 hours).
0	Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use.
0	This risk increases with age and with heavy smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age.
0	Women who use oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke.
0	Women who use oral contraceptives are strongly advised not to smoke.
0	Oral contraceptives should not be used in women who currently have the following conditions: Thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders A past history of deep vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders Cerebral vascular or coronary artery disease Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or jaundice with prior pill use Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas Known or suspected pregnancy Are receiving Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations.
0	To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Kariva<U+00AE> (desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol tablets) must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.
0	Kariva may be initiated using either a Sunday start or a Day 1 start.
0	NOTE: Each cycle pack dispenser is preprinted with the days of the week, starting with Sunday, to facilitate a Sunday start regimen.
0	Six different <U+201C>day label strips<U+201D> are provided with each cycle pack dispenser in order to accommodate a Day 1 start regimen.
0	In this case, the patient should place the self-adhesive <U+201C>day label strip<U+201D> that corresponds to her starting day over the preprinted days.
0	IMPORTANT: The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of use of Kariva should be considered.
0	The use of Kariva for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed.
0	When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease.
0	See also PRECAUTIONS for Nursing mothers).
0	If the patient starts on Kariva postpartum, and has not yet had a period, she should be instructed to use another method of contraception until a white tablet has been taken daily for 7 days.
0	SUNDAY START When initiating a Sunday start regimen, another method of contraception should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration.
0	Using a Sunday start, tablets are taken daily without interruption as follows: The first white tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins (if menstruation begins on Sunday, the first white tablet is taken on that day).
0	One white tablet is taken daily for 21 days, followed by 1 light-green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days and 1 light-blue (active) tablet daily for 5 days.
0	For all subsequent cycles, the patient then begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the next day (Sunday) after taking the last light-blue tablet.
0	[If switching from a Sunday start oral contraceptive, the first Kariva tablet should be taken on the second Sunday after the last tablet of a 21 day regimen or should be taken on the first Sunday after the last inactive tablet of a 28 day regimen.]
0	If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers.
0	If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack.
0	The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills.
0	If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should keep taking 1 white tablet daily until the next Sunday.
0	On Sunday the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day.
0	DAY 1 START Counting the first day of menstruation as <U+201C>Day 1<U+201D>, tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, one light-green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days followed by 1 light-blue (ethinyl estradiol) tablet daily for 5 days.
0	For all subsequent cycles, the patient then begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the next day after taking the last light-blue tablet.
0	[If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first white tablet should be taken on the first day of menstruation which begins after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product.]
0	If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or if the patient misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day.
0	Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases.
0	It is good medical practice for all women to have annual history and physical examinations, including women using oral contraceptives.
0	The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician.
0	The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests.
0	In case of undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy.
0	Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.
0	Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives.
0	Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.
0	If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued.
0	Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.
0	Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention.
0	They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.
0	Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree.
0	Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.
0	Reduced efficacy and increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding and menstrual irregularities have been associated with concomitant use of rifampin.
0	A similar association, though less marked, has been suggested with barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin sodium, carbamazepine and possibly with griseofulvin, ampicillin, and tetracyclines (72).
1	Combined hormonal contraceptives have been shown to significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lamotrigine when coadministered, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation.
0	This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary.
0	Consult the labeling of the concurrently-used drug to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.
0	Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy <U+2013> Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co-administer Kariva with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations.
0	Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives: Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.
0	Increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column or by radioimmunoassay.
1	Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered.
0	Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum.
0	Sex hormone-binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total circulating sex steroids; however, free or biologically active levels either decrease or remain unchanged.
0	High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides may be increased, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (Total-C) may be decreased or unchanged.
0	Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.
0	This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.
0	Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category X.
0	Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement.
0	In addition, oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk.
0	If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.
0	Safety and efficacy of Kariva tablets have been established in women of reproductive age.
0	Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older.
0	Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.
0	The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke, hepatic neoplasia, and gallbladder disease, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors.
0	The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity, and diabetes.
0	Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.
0	The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with formulations of higher doses of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today.
0	The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with formulations of lower doses of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.
0	Throughout this labeling, epidemiologic studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies.
0	Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of a disease, namely, a ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among non-users.
0	The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease.
0	Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and non-users.
0	The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population (Adapted from refs.
0	For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiologic methods. a. Thromboembolism An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established.
0	Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thromboembolic disease, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease (2, 3, 19 to 24).
0	Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization (25).
0	The risk of thromboembolic disease associated with oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped (2).
0	Several epidemiologic studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel, are associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than certain second generation oral contraceptives (102 to 104).
0	In general, these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk, which corresponds to an additional 1 to 2 cases of venous thromboembolism per 10,000 women-years of use.
0	However, data from additional studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.
0	A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of post-operative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives (9, 26).
0	The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions (9, 26).
0	If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization.
0	Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed. b. Myocardial infarction An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use.
0	This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes.
0	The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six (4 to 10).
0	The risk is very low in women under the age of 30.
0	Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarction in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases (11).
0	Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers, over the age of 35 and non-smokers over the age of 40 (Table III) among women who use oral contraceptives.
0	TABLE III: CIRCULATORY DISEASE MORTALITY RATES PER 100,000 WOMAN-YEARS BY AGE, SMOKING STATUS, AND ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE Adapted from P.M. Layde and V. Beral, ref.
0	Adapted from P.M. Layde and V. Beral, ref.
0	Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity (13).
0	In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism (14 to 18).
0	Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users.
0	Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
0	Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. c. Cerebrovascular diseases Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke.
0	Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and non-users, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes (27 to 29).
0	In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension (30).
0	The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension (30).
0	The attributable risk is also greater in older women (3). d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease (31 to 33).
0	A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents (14 to 16).
0	A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease.
0	Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogens used in the contraceptives.
0	The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.
0	Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics.
0	For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient.
0	New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing 0.035 mg or less of estrogen. e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives.
0	In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40 to 49 years old who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups (8).
0	In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small (34).
0	However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or more of estrogen.
0	Table III One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table IV).
0	These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure.
0	Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks.
0	The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth.
0	The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970<U+2019>s - but not reported until 1983 (35).
0	However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen formulations combined with careful consideration of risk factors.
0	Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed (100, 101), the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989.
0	The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.
0	Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.
0	Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.

0	Numerous epidemiologic studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian, and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives.
0	While there are conflicting reports, most studies suggest that the use of oral contraceptives is not associated with an overall increase in the risk of developing breast cancer.
0	Some studies have reported an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer, particularly at a younger age.
0	This increased relative risk appears to be related to duration of use (36 to 43, 79 to 89).
0	Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia in some populations of women (45 to 48).
0	However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.
0	Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States.
0	Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use especially with oral contraceptives of higher dose (49).
0	Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage (50, 51).
0	Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (52 to 54) in long-term (> 8 years) oral contraceptive users.
0	However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.
0	During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs.
0	Discontinue Kariva prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir.
0	Kariva can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.
0	There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives.
0	Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions.
0	Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.
0	Extensive epidemiologic studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy (55 to 57).
0	Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned (55, 56, 58, 59), when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.
0	The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy.
0	Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.
0	It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use.
0	If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the first missed period.
0	Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.
0	Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens (60, 61).
0	More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal (62 to 64).
0	The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.
0	Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in a significant percentage of users (17).
0	Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 micrograms of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance (65).
0	Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents (17, 66).
0	However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose (67).
0	Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully monitored while taking oral contraceptives.
0	A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill.
0	), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.
0	An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives (68) and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users (69) and with continued use (61).
0	Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (12) and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing quantities of progestogens.
0	Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease (70) should be encouraged to use another method of contraception.
0	If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued.
0	For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives (69), and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension between ever- and never-users (68, 70, 71).
0	The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.
0	Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use.
0	Non-hormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding.
0	If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem.
0	In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.
0	Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.
0	Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.
0	Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins.
0	Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).
0	Receptor binding studies, as well as studies in animals, have shown that etonogestrel, the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel, combines high progestational activity with minimal intrinsic androgenicity (91, 92).
0	The relevance of this latter finding in humans is unknown.
0	Desogestrel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed and converted into etonogestrel, its biologically active metabolite.
0	Following oral administration, the relative bioavailability of desogestrel compared to a solution, as measured by serum levels of etonogestrel, is approximately 100%.
0	Kariva (desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and ethinyl estradiol) Tablets provide two different regimens of ethinyl estradiol; 0.02 mg in the combination tablet [white] as well as 0.01 mg in the light-blue tablet.
0	Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed.
0	After a single dose of Kariva combination tablet [white], the relative bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is approximately 93% while the relative bioavailability of the 0.01 mg tablet [light-blue] is 99%.
0	The effect of food on the bioavailability of Kariva tablets following oral administration has not been evaluated.
0	The pharmacokinetics of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol following multiple dose administration of Kariva tablets were determined during the third cycle in 17 subjects.
0	Plasma concentrations of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol reached steady state by Day 21.
0	The AUC(0<U+2013>24) for etonogestrel at steady state on Day 21 was approximately 2.2 times higher than AUC(0<U+2013>24) on Day 1 of the third cycle.
0	The pharmacokinetic parameters of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol during the third cycle following multiple dose administration of Kariva tablets are summarized in Table I.

0	Ethinyl estradiol is approximately 98.3% bound, mainly to plasma albumin.
0	Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis.
0	Desogestrel, in combination with ethinyl estradiol, does not counteract the estrogen-induced increase in SHBG, resulting in lower serum levels of free testosterone (96 to 99).
0	Desogestrel Desogestrel is rapidly and completely metabolized by hydroxylation in the intestinal mucosa and on first pass through the liver to etonogestrel.
0	Other metabolites (i.e., 3a-OH-desogestrel, 3<U+00C3><U+0178>-OH-desogestrel, and 3a-OH-5a-H-desogestrel) with no pharmacologic actions also have been identified and these metabolites may undergo glucuronide and sulfate conjugation.
0	Ethinyl estradiol Ethinyl estradiol is subject to a significant degree of presystemic conjugation (phase II metabolism).
0	Ethinyl estradiol escaping gut wall conjugation undergoes phase I metabolism and hepatic conjugation (phase II metabolism).
0	Major phase I metabolites are 2-OH-ethinyl estradiol and 2-methoxy-ethinyl estradiol.
0	Sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of both ethinyl estradiol and phase I metabolites, which are excreted in bile, can undergo enterohepatic circulation.
0	Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol are excreted in urine, bile, and feces.
0	At steady state, on Day 21, the elimination half-life of etonogestrel is 27.8 <U+00B1> 7.2 hours and the elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol for the combination tablet is 23.9 <U+00B1> 25.5 hours.
0	For the 0.01 mg ethinyl estradiol tablet [light-blue], the elimination half-life at steady state, Day 28, is 18.9 <U+00B1> 8.3 hours.
0	There is no information to determine the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of Kariva.
0	No formal studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Kariva.

0	Interactions between desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol and other drugs have been reported in the literature.
0	No formal drug-drug interaction studies were conducted.
0	Oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to hydroxyzine hydrochloride products, and in patients with known hypersensitivity to cetirizine hydrochloride or levocetirizine hydrochloride.
0	Hydroxyzine is contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QT interval.
0	Hydroxyzine, when administered to the pregnant mouse, rat, and rabbit induced fetal abnormalities in the rat and mouse at doses substantially above the human therapeutic range.
0	Clinical data in human beings are inadequate to establish safety in early pregnancy.
0	Until such data are available, hydroxyzine is contraindicated in early pregnancy.
0	Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for patients who have shown a previous hypersensitivity to any component of this medication.
0	For symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested: adults, 50 to 100 mg q.i.d.
0	; children under 6 years, 50 mg daily in divided doses; children over 6 years, 50 to 100 mg daily in divided doses.
0	For use in the management of pruritus due to allergic conditions such as chronic urticaria and atopic and contact dermatoses and in histamine-mediated pruritus: adults, 25 mg t.i.d.
0	As a sedative when used as a premedication and following general anesthesia: 50 to 100 mg for adults and 0.6 mg/kg of body weight in children.
0	When treatment is initiated by the intramuscular route of administration, subsequent doses may be administered orally.
0	As with all potent medication, the dosage should be adjusted according to the patient<U+2019>s response to therapy.
0	THE POTENTIATING ACTION OF HYDROXYZINE MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE DRUG IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS NARCOTICS, NON-NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND BARBITURATES.
0	Therefore, when central nervous system depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine their dosage should be reduced.
0	QT Prolongation/Torsade de Pointes (TdP): Cases of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported during post-marketing use of hydroxyzine.
0	The majority of reports occurred in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation/TdP (pre-existing heart disease, electrolyte imbalances or concomitant arrhythmogenic drug use).
0	Therefore, hydroxyzine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.
0	Caution is recommended during the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval.
0	These include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, certain antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, clozapine, quetiapine, chlorpromazine), certain antidepressants (e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine), certain antibiotics (e.g., azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin); and others (e.g., pentamidine, methadone, ondansetron, droperidol).
0	Since drowsiness may occur with use of this drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydroxyzine.
0	Patients should also be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs, and cautioned that the effects of alcohol may be increased.
0	A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of hydroxyzine included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects.
0	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
0	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
0	The extent of renal excretion of hydroxyzine has not been determined.
0	Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections.
0	Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of hydroxyzine and observed closely.
0	Hydroxyzine may rarely cause acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), a serious skin reaction characterized by fever and numerous small, superficial, non-follicular, sterile pustules, arising within large areas of edematous erythema.
0	Inform patients about the signs of AGEP, and discontinue hydroxyzine at the first appearance of a skin rash, worsening of pre-existing skin reactions which hydroxyzine may be used to treat, or any other sign of hypersensitivity.
0	If signs or symptoms suggest AGEP, use of hydroxyzine should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.
0	Avoid cetirizine or levocetirizine in patients who have experienced AGEP or other hypersensitivity reactions with hydroxyzine, due to the risk of cross-sensitivity.
0	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
0	Since many drugs are so excreted, hydroxyzine should not be given to nursing mothers.
0	Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is unrelated chemically to the phenothiazines, reserpine, meprobamate or the benzodiazepines.
0	Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, but its action may be due to a suppression of activity in certain key regions of the subcortical area of the central nervous system.
0	Primary skeletal muscle relaxation has been demonstrated experimentally.
0	Bronchodilator activity, and antihistaminic and analgesic effects have been demonstrated experimentally and confirmed clinically.
0	An antiemetic effect, both by the apomorphine test and the veriloid test, has been demonstrated.
0	Pharmacological and clinical studies indicate that hydroxyzine in therapeutic dosage does not increase gastric secretion or acidity and in most cases has mild antisecretory activity.
0	Hydroxyzine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydroxyzine<U+2019>s clinical effects are usually noted within 15 to 30 minutes after oral administration.
0	BONIVA is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions: Abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes Hypocalcemia Known hypersensitivity to BONIVA or to any of its excipients.
0	Abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying such as stricture or achalasia (4, 5.1) Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes (4, 5.1) Hypocalcemia (4) Hypersensitivity to BONIVA (4)
0	Take one 150 mg tablet once monthly on the same day each month (2.1) Instruct patient to: (2.2) Swallow whole tablet with 6-8 oz of plain water only, at least 60 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of day.
0	Avoid lying down for at least 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.
0	Do not eat, drink (except for water), or take other medication for 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.
0	Take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake inadequate (2.3) The dose of BONIVA is one 150 mg tablet taken once monthly on the same date each month.
0	Instruct Patients to do the following: Take BONIVA at least 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins to maximize absorption and clinical benefit,.
0	Avoid the use of water with supplements including mineral water because they may have a higher concentration of calcium.
0	Swallow BONIVA tablets whole with a full glass of plain water (6 to 8 oz) while standing or sitting in an upright position to reduce the potential for esophageal irritation.
0	Avoid lying down for 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.
0	Do not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration.
0	Do not eat, drink anything except plain water, or take other medications for at least 60 minutes after taking BONIVA.
0	Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is inadequate.
1	Avoid the use of calcium supplements within 60 minutes of BONIVA administration because co-administration of BONIVA and calcium may interfere with the absorption of ibandronate sodium.
0	If the once-monthly dose is missed, instruct patients to do the following: If the next scheduled BONIVA day is more than 7 days away, take one BONIVA 150 mg tablet in the morning following the date that it is remembered.
0	If the next scheduled BONIVA day is only 1 to 7 days away, wait until the subsequent month's scheduled BONIVA day to take their tablet.
0	For subsequent monthly doses for both of the above scenarios, instruct patients to return to their original schedule by taking one BONIVA 150 mg tablet every month on their previous chosen day.
1	Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medications may interfere with absorption of ibandronate.
0	Do not take within 60 minutes of dosing (7.1) Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation.
1	Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of BONIVA.
0	Therefore, instruct patients to take BONIVA at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins).
0	Also, patients should wait at least 60 minutes after dosing before taking any other oral medications.
0	Because aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with BONIVA.
1	In healthy volunteers, co-administration with ranitidine resulted in a 20% increased bioavailability of ibandronate, which was not considered to be clinically relevant.
0	Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone-imaging agents.
0	Specific studies with ibandronate have not been performed.
0	Upper gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur.
0	Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions and discontinue use if new or worsening symptoms occur.
0	Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment.
0	Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur.
0	Consider discontinuing use if symptoms develop.
0	Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported.
0	Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported.
0	Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture.
0	BONIVA, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa.
0	Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BONIVA is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or ulcers).
0	Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates.
0	In some cases, these have been severe and required hospitalization.
0	Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue BONIVA and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn.
0	The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates and/or who fail to swallow it with the recommended full glass (6-8 oz) of water, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation.
0	Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient.
0	In patients who cannot comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BONIVA should be used under appropriate supervision.
0	There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials.
0	Hypocalcemia has been reported in patients taking BONIVA.
0	Treat hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before starting BONIVA therapy.
0	Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking BONIVA and other bisphosphonates.
0	The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug.
0	Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping.
0	A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.
0	Consider discontinuing use if severe symptoms develop.
0	Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including BONIVA.
0	Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures).
0	The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of exposure to bisphosphonates.
0	For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ.
0	Clinical judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment.
0	Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon.
0	In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition.
0	Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment.
0	Atypical, low-energy, or low-trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients.
0	These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution.
0	Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not been treated with bisphosphonates.
0	Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area.
0	They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs.
0	A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture.
0	Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture.
0	Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb.
0	Interruption of bisphosphonate therapy should be considered, pending a risk/benefit assessment, on an individual basis.
0	BONIVA is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/min).
0	The action of ibandronate on bone tissue is based on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone.
0	Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover.
0	In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass.
0	Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk, most commonly at the spine, hip, and wrist.
0	The diagnosis can be confirmed by a finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis indicative of vertebral fracture.
0	While osteoporosis occurs in both men and women, it is most common among women following menopause.
0	In healthy humans, bone formation and resorption are closely linked; old bone is resorbed and replaced by newly formed bone.
0	In postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone resorption exceeds bone formation, leading to bone loss and increased risk of fracture.
0	After menopause, the risk of fractures of the spine and hip increases; approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture during their remaining lifetimes.
0	BONIVA produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases of biochemical markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked C-telopeptide of Type I collagen) in the daily dose range of 0.25 mg to 5 mg and once-monthly doses from 100 mg to 150 mg in postmenopausal women.
0	Treatment with 2.5 mg daily BONIVA resulted in decreases in biochemical markers of bone turnover, including urinary C-terminal telopeptide of Type I collagen (uCTX) and serum osteocalcin, to levels similar to those in premenopausal women.
0	Changes in markers of bone formation were observed later than changes in resorption markers, as expected, due to the coupled nature of bone resorption and formation.
0	Treatment with 2.5 mg daily BONIVA decreased levels of uCTX within 1 month of starting treatment and decreased levels of osteocalcin within 3 months.
0	Bone turnover markers reached a nadir of approximately 64% below baseline values by 6 months of treatment and remained stable with continued treatment for up to 3 years.
0	Following treatment discontinuation, there is a return to pretreatment baseline rates of elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
0	In a 1-year, study comparing once-monthly vs. once-daily oral dosing regimens, the median decrease from baseline in serum CTX values was -76% for patients treated with the 150 mg once-monthly regimen and -67% for patients treated with the 2.5 mg daily regimen.
0	In a 1-year, prevention study comparing BONIVA 150 mg once-monthly to placebo, the median placebo-subtracted decrease in sCTX was -49.8%.
0	Absorption The absorption of oral ibandronate occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
0	Plasma concentrations increase in a dose-linear manner up to 50 mg oral intake and increases nonlinearly above this dose.
0	Following oral dosing, the time to maximum observed plasma ibandronate concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in fasted healthy postmenopausal women.
0	The mean oral bioavailability of 2.5 mg ibandronate was about 0.6% compared to intravenous dosing.
1	The extent of absorption is impaired by food or beverages (other than plain water).
1	The oral bioavailability of ibandronate is reduced by about 90% when BONIVA is administered concomitantly with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability observed in fasted subjects.
0	There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability when ibandronate is taken at least 60 minutes before a meal.
0	However, both bioavailability and the effect on bone mineral density (BMD) are reduced when food or beverages are taken less than 60 minutes following an ibandronate dose.
0	Distribution After absorption, ibandronate either rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine.
0	In humans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 L, and the amount of dose removed from the circulation via the bone is estimated to be 40% to 50% of the circulating dose.
0	In vitro protein binding in human serum was 99.5% to 90.9% over an ibandronate concentration range of 2 to 10 ng/mL in one study and approximately 85.7% over a concentration range of 0.5 to 10 ng/mL in another study.
0	Metabolism Ibandronate does not undergo hepatic metabolism and does not inhibit the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.
0	Ibandronate is eliminated by renal excretion.
0	Based on a rat study, the ibandronate secretory pathway does not appear to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the excretion of other drugs.
0	There is no evidence that ibandronate is metabolized in humans.
0	Elimination The portion of ibandronate that is not removed from the circulation via bone absorption is eliminated unchanged by the kidney (approximately 50% to 60% of the absorbed dose).
0	Unabsorbed ibandronate is eliminated unchanged in the feces.
0	The plasma elimination of ibandronate is multiphasic.
0	Its renal clearance and distribution into bone accounts for a rapid and early decline in plasma concentrations, reaching 10% of the Cmax within 3 or 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration, respectively.
0	This is followed by a slower clearance phase as ibandronate redistributes back into the blood from bone.
0	The observed apparent terminal half-life for ibandronate is generally dependent on the dose studied and on assay sensitivity.
0	The observed apparent terminal half-life for the 150 mg ibandronate tablet upon oral administration to healthy postmenopausal women ranges from 37 to 157 hours.
0	Total clearance of ibandronate is low, with average values in the range 84 to 160 mL/min.
0	Renal clearance (about 60 mL/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50% to 60% of total clearance and is related to creatinine clearance.
0	The difference between the apparent total and renal clearances likely reflects bone uptake of the drug.
0	Specific Populations Pediatrics The pharmacokinetics of ibandronate has not been studied in patients less than 18 years of age.
0	Geriatric Because ibandronate is not known to be metabolized, the only difference in ibandronate elimination for geriatric patients versus younger patients is expected to relate to progressive age-related changes in renal function.
0	Gender The bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ibandronate are similar in both men and women.
0	Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.
0	Renal Impairment Renal clearance of ibandronate in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly related to creatinine clearance (CLcr).
0	Following a single dose of 0.5 mg ibandronate by intravenous administration, patients with CLcr 40 to 70 mL/min had 55% higher exposure (AUC<U+221E>) than the exposure observed in subjects with CLcr greater than 90 mL/min.
0	Patients with CLcr less than 30 mL/min had more than a two-fold increase in exposure compared to the exposure for healthy subjects.
0	Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed to assess the pharmacokinetics of ibandronate in patients with hepatic impairment because ibandronate is not metabolized in the human liver.
1	Drug Interaction Studies Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron), including milk, food, and antacids are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate, which is consistent with findings in animal studies.
1	H2 Blockers A pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that 75 mg ranitidine (25 mg injected intravenously 90 and 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after ibandronate administration) increased the oral bioavailability of 10 mg ibandronate by about 20%.
0	This degree of increase is not considered to be clinically relevant.
0	Propantheline is contraindicated in patients with: 1.Glaucoma, since mydriasis is to be avoided.
0	2.Obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract (pyloroduodenal stenosis, achalasia, paralytic ileus, etc.
0	3.Obstructive uropathy (e.g., bladder-neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy).
0	4.Intestinal atony of elderly or debilitated patients.
0	5.Severe ulcerative colitis or toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis.
0	6.Unstable cardiovascular adjustment in acute hemorrhage.
0	The usual initial adult dose of propantheline bromide tablets is 15 mg taken 30 minutes before each meal and 30 mg at bedtime (a total of 75 mg daily).
0	Subsequent dosage adjustment should be made according to the patient<U+2019>s individual response and tolerance.
0	Anticholinergics may delay absorption of other medication given concomitantly.
0	Excessive cholinergic blockade may occur if propantheline is given concomitantly with belladonna alkaloids or synthetic and semisynthetic anticholinergic agents, narcotic analgesics such as meperidine, Type 1 antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., disopyramide, procainamide, or quinidine), antihistamines, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, or other psychoactive drugs.
0	Propantheline may also potentiate the sedative effect of phenothiazines.
0	Increased intraocular pressure may result from concurrent administration of anticholinergics and corticosteroids.
1	Concurrent use of propantheline with slow-dissolving tablets of digoxin may cause increased serum digoxin levels.
0	This interaction can be avoided by using only those digoxin tablets that rapidly dissolve by USP standards.
0	Propantheline should be used with caution in the elderly and in all patients with autonomic neuropathy, hepatic or renal disease, hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, or hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis, since anticholinergics may aggravate this condition.
0	In patients with ulcerative colitis, large doses of propantheline may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing paralytic ileus and, for this reason, may precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon, a serious complication of the disease.
0	Propantheline may produce drowsiness or blurred vision.
0	The patient should be cautioned regarding activities requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work, while taking this drug.
0	No long-term fertility, carcinogenicity, or mutagenicity studies have been done with propantheline.
0	Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with propantheline.
0	It is also not known whether propantheline can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.
0	Propantheline should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
0	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
0	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when propantheline is administered to a nursing woman.
0	Suppression of lactation may occur with anticholinergic drugs.
0	Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
0	In the presence of a high environmental temperature, heat prostration (fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating) can occur with the use of propantheline.
0	Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy.
0	In this instance treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful.
0	With overdose, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis).
0	Propantheline may cause increased heart rate and therefore, should be used with caution in patients with heart disease.
0	Propantheline bromide inhibits gastrointestinal motility and diminishes gastric acid secretion.
0	The drug also inhibits the action of acetylcholine at the postganglionic nerve endings of the parasympathetic nervous system.
0	Propantheline bromide is extensively metabolized in man primarily by hydrolysis to the inactive materials xanthene-9-carboxylic acid and (2-hydroxyethyl) diisopropylmethylammonium bromide.
0	In a bioavailability study, peak plasma concentrations of propantheline were achieved in about one hour, following a single oral dose.
0	The plasma elimination half-life of propantheline is about 1.6 hours.
0	Approximately 70% of the dose is excreted in the urine, mostly as metabolites.
0	The urinary excretion of propantheline is about 3% after oral tablet administration.
0	Combination oral contraceptives should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: Thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders A past history of deep-vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders Cerebral-vascular or coronary-artery disease (current or history) Valvular heart disease with thrombogenic complications Thrombogenic rhythm disorders Major surgery with prolonged immobilization Diabetes with vascular involvement Headaches with focal neurological symptoms Uncontrolled hypertension Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or personal history of breast cancer Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or jaundice with prior pill use Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas, or active liver disease, as long as liver function has not returned to normal Known or suspected pregnancy Hypersensitivity to any of the components of Ogestrel<U+00AE> Are receiving Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations.
0	To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Ogestrel must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours.
0	The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.
0	The dosage of Ogestrel is one white tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to prescribed schedule.
0	It is recommended that Ogestrel tablets be taken at the same time each day.
0	During the first cycle of medication, the patient is instructed to begin taking Ogestrel on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation.
0	If menstruation begins on a Sunday, the first tablet (white) is taken that day.
0	One white tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
0	Withdrawal bleeding should usually occur within three days following discontinuation of white tablets and may not have finished before the next pack is started.
0	During the first cycle, contraceptive reliance should not be placed on Ogestrel until a white tablet has been taken daily for 7 consecutive days and a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control should be used during those 7 days.
0	The patient begins her next and all subsequent 28-day courses of tablets on the same day of the week (Sunday) on which she began her first course, following the same schedule: 21 days on white tablets<U+2014>7 days on peach inert tablets.
0	If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control until she has taken a white tablet daily for 7 consecutive days.
0	When the patient is switching from a 21-day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts Ogestrel.
0	She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week.
0	She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21-day regimen.
0	When the patient is switching from a 28-day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Ogestrel on the day after her last tablet.
0	She should not wait any days between packs.
0	The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin Ogestrel the next day.
0	If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start Ogestrel on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due.
0	In switching from a progestin-only pill, injection, or implant, the patient should be advised to use a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.
0	If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occurs, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen.
0	This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her health care professional.
0	Although pregnancy is unlikely if Ogestrel is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered.
0	If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken.
0	If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.
0	Hormonal contraceptives should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
0	For additional patient instructions regarding missed tablets, see the <U+201C>WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS<U+201D> section in the DETAILED PATIENT LABELING below.
0	Any time the patient misses two or more white tablets, she should also use another method of contraception until she has taken a white tablet daily for seven consecutive days.
0	If the patient misses one or more peach tablets, she is still protected against pregnancy provided she begins taking white tablets again on the proper day.
0	If breakthrough bleeding occurs following missed white tablets, it will usually be transient and of no consequence.
0	The possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled white tablets are missed.
0	Ogestrel may be initiated no earlier than day 28 postpartum in the non-lactating mother due to the increased risk for thromboembolism.
0	The patient should be advised to use a non-hormonal back-up method for the first 7 days of tablet-taking.
0	However, if intercourse has already occurred, the possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered.
0	In the case of first-trimester abortion, if the patient starts Ogestrel immediately, additional contraceptive measures are not needed.
0	General Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis.
0	Physical Examination and Follow-Up A periodic personal and family medical history and complete physical examination are appropriate for all women, including women using oral contraceptives.
0	The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician.
0	The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests.
0	In case of undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate diagnostic measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy.
0	Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care.
0	Lipid Disorders Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives.
0	Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult.
0	In patients with familial defects of lipoprotein metabolism receiving estrogen containing preparations, there have been case reports of significant elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis.
0	Liver Function If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such hormonal contraceptives, the medication should be discontinued.
0	Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function.
0	Fluid Retention Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention.
0	They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention.
0	Emotional Disorders Patients becoming significantly depressed while taking oral contraceptives should stop the medication and use an alternate method of contraception in an attempt to determine whether the symptom is drug related.
0	Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if significant depression occurs.
0	Contact Lenses Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist.
0	Gastrointestinal Motility Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption.
0	Drug Interactions Changes in contraceptive effectiveness associated with coadministration of other products: Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids.
0	This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding.
0	Examples include rifampin, barbiturates, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and griseofulvin.
0	It may take several weeks until enzyme induction has completely subsided, depending on dosage, duration of use, and rate of elimination of the inducing substance.
0	Several cases of contraceptive failure and breakthrough bleeding have been reported in the literature with concomitant administration of antibiotics such as ampicillin and tetracyclines.
0	However, clinical pharmacology studies investigating drug interactions between combined oral contraceptives and these antibiotics have reported inconsistent results.
0	Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with coadministration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases.
0	The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors.
0	Health care professionals should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information.
0	Herbal products containing St. John<U+2019>s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P 450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids.
0	This may also result in breakthrough bleeding.
1	Increase in plasma levels associated with coadministered drugs: Coadministration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increase AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%.
1	Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma ethinyl estradiol levels, possibly by inhibition of conjugation.
1	CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone levels.
0	Changes in plasma levels of coadministered drugs: Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds.
1	Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, prednisolone and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives.
1	Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation, have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives.
0	Troleandomycin may increase the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis during coadministration with combination oral contraceptives.
0	The prescribing information of concomitant medications should be consulted to identify potential interactions.
0	Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy <U+2013> Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co-administer Ogestrel with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations.
0	Interactions with Laboratory Tests Certain endocrine- and liver-function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives: Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability.
0	Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column or by radioimmunoassay.
1	Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T4 concentration is unaltered.
0	Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum.
0	Sex-hormone-binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total circulating sex steroids and corticoids; however, free or biologically active levels remain unchanged.
0	Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected.
0	Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy.
0	This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives.
0	See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections.
0	Nursing Mothers Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and/or metabolites have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers, and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement.
0	In addition, combination oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk.
0	If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use combination oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child.
0	Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Ogestrel tablets have been established in women of reproductive age.
0	Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older.
0	Use of this product before menarche is not indicated.
0	Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population.
0	Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral contraceptive use.
0	This risk increases with age and with the extent of smoking (in epidemiologic studies, 15 or more cigarettes per day was associated with a significantly increased risk) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age.
0	Women who use oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke.
0	The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events (such as myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, and stroke), hepatic neoplasia, gallbladder disease, and hypertension, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors.
0	The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity and diabetes.
0	Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks.
0	The information contained in this package insert is based principally on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher formulations of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today.
0	The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lower formulations of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined.
0	Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies.
0	Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of disease, namely, a ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among non-users.
0	The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease.
0	Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and non-users.
0	The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population.
0	For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods.
0	Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems a. Myocardial infarction An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use.
0	This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary-artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes.
0	The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be 2 to 6.
0	The risk is very low under the age of 30.
0	Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarction in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases.
0	Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and non-smokers over the age of 40 (Table II) among women who use oral contraceptives.
0	CIRCULATORY DISEASE MORTALITY RATES PER 100,000 WOMAN YEARS BY AGE, SMOKING STATUS AND ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE TABLE II: (Adapted From P.M. Layde And V. Beral, Lancet, 1:541-546, 1981.)
0	Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age, and obesity.
0	In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism.
0	Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users.
0	Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
0	Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. b. Thromboembolism An increased risk of venous thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established.
0	Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease.
0	Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization.
0	The approximate incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in users of low dose (<50 mcg ethinyl estradiol) combination oral contraceptives is up to 4 per 10,000 woman-years compared to 0.5-3 per 10,000 woman-years for non-users.
0	However, the incidence is less than that associated with pregnancy (6 per 10,000 woman-years).
0	The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped.
0	A 2- to 4-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives.
0	The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions.
0	If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to and for 2 weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization.
0	Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed. c. Cerebrovascular diseases Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke.
0	Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and non-users for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes.
0	In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.
0	The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users, and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension.
0	The attributable risk is also greater in older women.
0	Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hyperlipidemias, and obesity.
0	Women with migraine (particularly migraine with aura) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke. d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.
0	A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents.
0	A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease.
0	Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive.
0	The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive.
0	Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics.
0	For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient.
0	New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient. e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives.
0	In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40<U+2013>49 years who had used oral contraceptives for 5 or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.
0	In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.
0	However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 mcg or higher of estrogen.
0	Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table III).
0	These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure.
0	Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks.
0	The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is less than that associated with childbirth.
0	The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970<U+2019>s<U+2014>but not reported until 1983.
0	However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling.
0	Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989.
0	The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular-disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception.
0	Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks.
0	Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective.

0	Carcinoma of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives.
0	Although the risk of having breast cancer diagnosed may be slightly increased among current and recent users of combined oral contraceptives (RR=1.24), this excess risk decreases over time after combination oral contraceptive discontinuation and by 10 years after cessation the increased risk disappears.
0	The risk does not increase with duration of use and no consistent relationships have been found with dose or type of steroid.
0	The patterns of risk are also similar regardless of a woman<U+2019>s reproductive history or her family breast cancer history.
0	The subgroup for whom risk has been found to be significantly elevated is women who first used oral contraceptives before age 20, but because breast cancer is so rare at these young ages, the number of cases attributable to this early oral contraceptive use is extremely small.
0	Breast cancers diagnosed in current or previous oral contraceptive users tend to be less clinically advanced than in never-users.
0	Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is a hormone sensitive tumor.
0	Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive cervical cancer in some populations of women.
0	However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors.
0	In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established.
0	Hepatic Neoplasia Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States.
0	Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after 4 or more years of use.
0	Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
0	Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) oral contraceptive users.
0	However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S., and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users.
0	Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs.
0	Discontinue Ogestrel prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir.
0	Ogestrel can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen.
0	Ocular Lesions There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives that may lead to partial or complete loss of vision.
0	Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions.
0	Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately.
0	Oral Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in infants born to women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy.
0	Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect, particularly insofar as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy.
0	The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy.
0	Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion.
0	It is recommended that for any patient who has missed 2 consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.
0	If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period.
0	Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
0	Gallbladder Disease Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens.
0	More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal.
0	The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens.
0	Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users.
0	Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance.
0	Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents.
0	However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose.
0	Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.
0	A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill.
0	As discussed earlier, changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.
0	Elevated Blood Pressure Women with significant hypertension should not be started on hormonal contraception.
0	An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives, and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users and with continued use.
0	Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing quantities of progestogens.
0	Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease, should be encouraged to use another method of contraception.
0	If women with hypertension elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely, and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued.
0	For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever- and never-users.
0	Headache The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.
0	Bleeding Irregularities Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first 3 months of use.
0	The type and dose of progestogen may be important.
0	If bleeding persists or recurs, non-hormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding.
0	If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem.
0	In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.
0	Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea (possibly with anovulation), especially when such a condition was pre-existent.
0	Ectopic Pregnancy Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures.
0	Mode of Action Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins.
0	Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation).
0	DEXILANT is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.
0	Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported.
0	Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been reported with other proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including lansoprazole of which dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer.
0	PPIs, including DEXILANT, are contraindicated with rilpivirine-containing products.
0	Patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.

0	Tables 3 and 4 include drugs with clinically important drug interactions and interaction with diagnostics when administered concomitantly with DEXILANT and instructions for preventing or managing them.
0	Consult the labeling of concomitantly used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with PPIs.
0	Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with DEXILANT and Interactions with Diagnostics Antiretrovirals Clinical Impact: The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable.
0	The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known.
0	Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with dexlansoprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance.
1	Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with dexlansoprazole may increase toxicity of the antiretroviral drugs.
0	There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with dexlansoprazole.
0	Intervention: Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with DEXILANT is contraindicated.
0	Atazanavir: See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information.
0	Nelfinavir: Avoid concomitant use with DEXILANT.
0	See prescribing information for nelfinavir.
0	Saquinavir: See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities.
0	Other antiretrovirals: See prescribing information.
0	Warfarin Clinical Impact: Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and warfarin concomitantly.
0	Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.
0	Intervention: Monitor INR and prothrombin time.
0	Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range.
0	See prescribing information for warfarin.
1	Methotrexate Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.
0	No formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted.
0	Intervention: A temporary withdrawal of DEXILANT may be considered in some patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.
1	Digoxin Clinical Impact: Potential for increased exposure of digoxin.
0	Intervention: Monitor digoxin concentrations.
0	Dose adjustment of digoxin may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations.
1	Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole) Clinical Impact: Dexlansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.
1	Intervention: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH.
1	The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving DEXILANT and MMF.
0	Use DEXILANT with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF.See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption.
1	Tacrolimus Clinical Impact: Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.
0	Intervention: Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations.
0	Dose adjustment of tacrolimus may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations.
0	See prescribing information for tacrolimus.
0	Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors Clinical Impact: CgA levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity.
0	The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.
0	Intervention: Temporarily stop DEXILANT treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.
0	If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.
0	Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test Clinical Impact: Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma.
0	Intervention: Temporarily stop DEXILANT treatment at least 30 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline.
0	False Positive Urine Tests for THC Clinical Impact: There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs.
0	Intervention: An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.
1	Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting DEXILANT When Co-Administered with Other Drugs and Substances CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact: Decreased exposure of dexlansoprazole when used concomitantly with strong inducers.
0	Intervention: St. John's Wort, rifampin: Avoid concomitant use with DEXILANT.
0	Ritonavir-containing products: See prescribing information.
1	CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Increased exposure of dexlansoprazole is expected when used concomitantly with strong inhibitors.
0	Intervention: Voriconazole: See prescribing information.
0	See full prescribing information for a list of clinically important drug interactions.
0	Gastric Malignancy: In adults, symptomatic response with DEXILANT does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.
0	Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing.
0	Acute Interstitial Nephritis: Observed in patients taking PPIs.
0	Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea: PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk.
0	Bone Fracture: Long-term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine.
0	Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Mostly cutaneous; new onset or exacerbation of existing disease; discontinue DEXILANT and refer to specialist for evaluation.
1	Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) Deficiency: Daily long-term use (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption or a deficiency of cyanocobalamin.
0	Hypomagnesemia: Reported rarely with prolonged treatment with PPIs.
0	Interactions with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors: Increases in intragastric pH may result in hypergastrinemia and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased chromogranin A levels which may interfere with diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.
1	Interaction with Methotrexate: Concomitant use with PPIs may elevate and/or prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to toxicity.
0	With high-dose methotrexate administration, consider a temporary withdrawal of DEXILANT.
0	Fundic Gland Polyps: Risk increases with long-term use, especially beyond 1 year.
0	In adults, symptomatic response to therapy with DEXILANT does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.
0	Consider additional follow-up and diagnostic testing in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with a PPI.
0	In older patients, also consider an endoscopy.
0	Acute interstitial nephritis has been observed in patients taking PPIs including lansoprazole.
0	Acute interstitial nephritis may occur at any point during PPI therapy and is generally attributed to an idiopathic hypersensitivity reaction.
0	Discontinue DEXILANT if acute interstitial nephritis develops.
0	Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy like DEXILANT may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients.
0	This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve.
0	Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.
0	Several published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist or spine.
0	The risk of fracture was increased in patients who received high-dose, defined as multiple daily doses, and long-term PPI therapy (a year or longer).
0	Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the conditions being treated.
0	Patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures should be managed according to established treatment guidelines.
0	Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs.
0	These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease.
0	The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematosus cases were CLE.
0	The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly.
0	Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.
0	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs.
0	PPI-associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE.
0	Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly.
0	The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.
0	Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated.
0	If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving DEXILANT, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation.
0	Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in four to 12 weeks.
0	Serological testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.
1	Daily treatment with any acid-suppressing medications over a long period of time (e.g., longer than three years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12) caused by hypo- or achlorhydria.
1	Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid-suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature.
1	This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed in patients treated with DEXILANT.
0	Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy.
0	Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures.
1	In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.
0	For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), healthcare professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically.
0	Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity.
0	Healthcare providers should temporarily stop dexlansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high.
1	Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities.
0	In high-dose methotrexate administration, a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients.
0	PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year.
0	Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy.
0	Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.
0	Dexlansoprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the (H+, K+)-ATPase at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell.
0	Because this enzyme is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the parietal cell, dexlansoprazole has been characterized as a gastric proton-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production.
0	Antisecretory Activity The effects of DEXILANT 60 mg (n=20) or lansoprazole 30 mg (n=23) once daily for five days on 24 hour intragastric pH were assessed in healthy subjects in a multiple-dose crossover study.
0	Effect on 24 Hour Intragastric pH on Day 5 After Administration of DEXILANT or Lansoprazole DEXILANT60 mg Lansoprazole30 mg Mean Intragastric pH 4.55 4.13 % Time Intragastric pH >4 (hours) 71(17 hours) 60(14 hours) Serum Gastrin Effects The effect of dexlansoprazole on serum gastrin concentrations was evaluated in approximately 3460 patients in clinical trials up to eight weeks and in 1023 patients for up to six to 12 months.
0	The mean fasting gastrin concentrations increased from baseline during treatment with 30 and 60 mg DEXILANT.
0	In patients treated for more than six months, mean serum gastrin levels increased during approximately the first three months of treatment and were stable for the remainder of treatment.
0	Mean serum gastrin levels returned to pre-treatment levels within one month of discontinuation of treatment.
0	Increased gastrin causes enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and increased serum CgA levels.
0	The increased CgA levels may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.
0	Enterochromaffin-Like Cell (ECL) Effects There were no reports of ECL cell hyperplasia in gastric biopsy specimens obtained from 653 patients treated with DEXILANT 30, 60, or 90 mg for up to 12 months.
0	During lifetime exposure of rats dosed daily with up to 150 mg/kg/day of lansoprazole, marked hypergastrinemia was observed followed by ECL cell proliferation and formation of carcinoid tumors, especially in female rats.
0	Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose five times the maximum recommended dose, dexlansoprazole does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.
0	The dual delayed-release formulation of DEXILANT results in a dexlansoprazole plasma concentration-time profile with two distinct peaks; the first peak occurs one to two hours after administration, followed by a second peak within four to five hours.
0	Dexlansoprazole is eliminated with a half-life of approximately one to two hours in healthy subjects and in patients with symptomatic GERD.
0	No accumulation of dexlansoprazole occurs after multiple, once daily doses of DEXILANT 30 or 60 mg although mean AUCt and Cmax values of dexlansoprazole were slightly higher (less than 10%) on Day 5 than on Day 1.
0	Figure 1: Mean Plasma Dexlansoprazole Concentration <U+2013> Time Profile Following Oral Administration of 30 or 60 mg DEXILANT Once Daily for 5 Days in Healthy Adult Subjects The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole are highly variable, with percent coefficient of variation (%CV) values for Cmax, AUC, and CL/F of greater than 30%.

0	When granules of DEXILANT 60 mg are mixed with water and dosed via NG tube or orally via syringe, the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) of dexlansoprazole was similar to that when DEXILANT 60 mg was administered as an intact capsule.
1	Effect on Food In food-effect studies in healthy subjects receiving DEXILANT under various fed conditions compared to fasting, increases in Cmax ranged from 12 to 55%, increases in AUC ranged from 9 to 37%, and Tmax varied (ranging from a decrease of 0.7 hours to an increase of three hours).
0	Distribution Plasma protein binding of dexlansoprazole ranged from 96 to 99% in healthy subjects and was independent of concentration from 0.01 to 20 mcg/mL.
0	The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) after multiple doses in symptomatic GERD patients was 40 L. Elimination Metabolism Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver by oxidation, reduction, and subsequent formation of sulfate, glucuronide and glutathione conjugates to inactive metabolites.
0	Oxidative metabolites are formed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system including hydroxylation mainly by CYP2C19, and oxidation to the sulfone by CYP3A4.
0	CYP2C19 is a polymorphic liver enzyme which exhibits three phenotypes in the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates: extensive metabolizers (*1/*1), intermediate metabolizers (*1/mutant) and poor metabolizers (mutant/mutant).
0	Dexlansoprazole is the major circulating component in plasma regardless of CYP2C19 metabolizer status.
0	In CYP2C19 intermediate and extensive metabolizers, the major plasma metabolites are 5-hydroxy dexlansoprazole and its glucuronide conjugate, while in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers dexlansoprazole sulfone is the major plasma metabolite.
0	Excretion Following the administration of DEXILANT, no unchanged dexlansoprazole is excreted in urine.
0	Following the administration of [14C] dexlansoprazole to six healthy male subjects, approximately 50.7% (standard deviation (SD): 9.0%) of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and 47.6% (SD: 7.3%) in the feces.
0	Apparent clearance (CL/F) in healthy subjects was 11.4 to 11.6 L/hour, respectively, after five days of 30 or 60 mg once daily administration.
0	Specific Populations Age: Pediatric Population The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole in patients under the age of 12 years have not been studied.
0	Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole were studied in 36 patients 12 to 17 years of age with symptomatic GERD in a multi-center trial.
0	Patients were randomized to receive DEXILANT 30 or 60 mg once daily for seven days.
0	The dexlansoprazole mean Cmax and AUC in patients 12 to 17 years of age were 105 and 88%, respectively, compared to those observed in adults at the 30 mg dose, and were 81 and 78%, respectively, at the 60 mg dose.

0	Dexlansoprazole exhibited higher systemic exposure (AUC) in geriatric subjects (34% higher) than younger subjects.
0	Sex In a study of 12 male and 12 female healthy subjects who received a single dose of DEXILANT 60 mg, females had higher systemic exposure (AUC) (43% higher) than males.
0	This difference in exposure between males and female does not represent a significant safety concern.
0	Renal Impairment Dexlansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites, and no parent drug is recovered in the urine following an oral dose of dexlansoprazole.
0	Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole are not expected to be altered in patients with renal impairment, and no studies were conducted in patients with renal impairment.
0	In addition, the pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole were not clinically different in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function.
0	Hepatic Impairment In a study of 12 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) who received a single dose of 60 mg DEXILANT, the systemic exposure (AUC) of bound and unbound dexlansoprazole was approximately two times greater compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.
0	This difference in exposure was not due to a difference in protein binding.
0	No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).
0	Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of Dexlansoprazole on Other Drugs Cytochrome P 450 Interactions Dexlansoprazole is metabolized, in part, by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.
0	In vitro studies have shown that dexlansoprazole is not likely to inhibit CYP isoforms 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 or 3A4.
0	As such, no clinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes would be expected.
0	Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that DEXILANT did not have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered phenytoin (CYP2C9 substrate) or theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate).
0	The subjects' CYP1A2 genotypes in the drug-drug interaction study with theophylline were not determined.
0	Although in vitro studies indicated that DEXILANT has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 in vivo, an in vivo drug-drug interaction study in mainly CYP2C19 extensive and intermediate metabolizers has shown that DEXILANT does not affect the pharmacokinetics of diazepam (CYP2C19 substrate).
0	Clopidogrel Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19.
0	A study of healthy subjects who were CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers, receiving once daily administration of clopidogrel 75 mg alone or concomitantly with DEXILANT 60 mg (n=40), for nine days was conducted.
1	The mean AUC of the active metabolite of clopidogrel was reduced by approximately 9% (mean AUC ratio was 91%, with 90% CI of 86 to 97%) when DEXILANT was co-administered compared to administration of clopidogrel alone.
0	Pharmacodynamic parameters were also measured and demonstrated that the change in inhibition of platelet aggregation (induced by 5 mcM ADP) was related to the change in the exposure to clopidogrel active metabolite.
0	The effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel and on clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition is not considered clinically important.
0	Effect of Other Drugs on Dexlansoprazole Because dexlansoprazole is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, inducers and inhibitors of these enzymes may potentially alter exposure of dexlansoprazole.
0	Figure 1 Effect of CYP2C19 Polymorphism on Systemic Exposure of Dexlansoprazole Systemic exposure of dexlansoprazole is generally higher in intermediate and poor metabolizers.
0	In male Japanese subjects who received a single dose of DEXILANT 30 or 60 mg (N=2 to 6 subjects/group), mean dexlansoprazole Cmax and AUC values were up to two times higher in intermediate compared to extensive metabolizers; in poor metabolizers, mean Cmax was up to four times higher and mean AUC was up to 12 times higher compared to extensive metabolizers.
0	Though such study was not conducted in Caucasians and African Americans, it is expected dexlansoprazole exposure in these races will be affected by CYP2C19 phenotypes as well.
0	All diuretics, including ethacrynic acid, are contraindicated in anuria.
0	If increasing electrolyte imbalance, azotemia, and/or oliguria occur during treatment of severe, progressive renal disease, the diuretic should be discontinued.
0	In a few patients this diuretic has produced severe, watery diarrhea.
0	If this occurs, it should be discontinued and not used again.
0	Until further experience in infants is accumulated, therapy with oral and parenteral EDECRIN is contraindicated.
0	Hypersensitivity to any component of this product.
0	Dosage must be regulated carefully to prevent a more rapid or substantial loss of fluid or electrolyte than is indicated or necessary.
0	The magnitude of diuresis and natriuresis is largely dependent on the degree of fluid accumulation present in the patient.
0	Similarly, the extent of potassium excretion is determined in large measure by the presence and magnitude of aldosteronism.
0	EDECRIN is available for oral use as 25 mg tablets.
0	In Adults: The smallest dose required to produce gradual weight loss (about 1 to 2 pounds per day) is recommended.
0	Onset of diuresis usually occurs at 50 to 100 mg for adults.
0	After diuresis has been achieved, the minimally effective dose (usually from 50 to 200 mg daily) may be given on a continuous or intermittent dosage schedule.
0	Dosage adjustments are usually in 25 to 50 mg increments to avoid derangement of water and electrolyte excretion.
0	The patient should be weighed under standard conditions before and during the institution of diuretic therapy with this compound.
0	The following schedule may be helpful in determining the smallest effective dose.
0	Day 1 <U+2014> 50 mg once daily after a meal Day 2 <U+2014> 50 mg twice daily after meals, if necessary Day 3 <U+2014> 100 mg in the morning and 50 to 100 mg following the afternoon or evening meal, depending upon response to the morning dose.
0	A few patients may require initial and maintenance doses as high as 200 mg twice daily.
0	These higher doses, which should be achieved gradually, are most often required in patients with severe, refractory edema.
0	In Pediatric Patients (excluding infants, see CONTRAINDICATIONS): The initial dose should be 25 mg.
0	Careful stepwise increments in dosage of 25 mg should be made to achieve effective maintenance.
0	It is usually possible to reduce the dosage and frequency of administration once dry weight has been achieved.
0	EDECRIN (Ethacrynic Acid) may be given intermittently after an effective diuresis is obtained with the regimen outlined above.
0	Dosage may be on an alternate daily schedule or more prolonged periods of diuretic therapy may be interspersed with rest periods.
0	Such an intermittent dosage schedule allows time for correction of any electrolyte imbalance and may provide a more efficient diuretic response.
0	The chloruretic effect of this agent may give rise to retention of bicarbonate and a metabolic alkalosis.
0	This may be corrected by giving chloride (ammonium chloride or arginine chloride).
0	Ammonium chloride should not be given to cirrhotic patients.
0	EDECRIN has additive effects when used with other diuretics.
0	For example, a patient who is on maintenance dosage of an oral diuretic may require additional intermittent diuretic therapy, such as an organomercurial, for the maintenance of basal weight.
0	The intermittent use of EDECRIN orally may eliminate the need for injections of organomercurials.
0	Small doses of EDECRIN may be added to existing diuretic regimens to maintain basal weight.
0	This drug may potentiate the action of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, with augmentation of natriuresis and kaliuresis.
0	Therefore, when adding EDECRIN the initial dose and changes of dose should be in 25 mg increments, to avoid electrolyte depletion.
0	Rarely, patients who failed to respond to ethacrynic acid have responded to older established agents.
0	While many patients do not require supplemental potassium, the use of potassium chloride or potassium-sparing agents, or both, during treatment with EDECRIN is advisable, especially in cirrhotic or nephrotic patients and in patients receiving digitalis.
0	Salt liberalization usually prevents the development of hyponatremia and hypochloremia.
0	During treatment with EDECRIN, salt may be liberalized to a greater extent than with other diuretics.
0	Cirrhotic patients, however, usually require at least moderate salt restriction concomitant with diuretic therapy.
0	Intravenous SODIUM EDECRIN is for intravenous use when oral intake is impractical or in urgent conditions, such as acute pulmonary edema.
0	The usual intravenous dose for the average sized adult is 50 mg, or 0.5 to 1.0 mg per kg of body weight.
0	Usually only one dose has been necessary; occasionally a second dose at a new injection site, to avoid possible thrombophlebitis, may be required.
0	A single intravenous dose not exceeding 100 mg has been used in critical situations.
0	Insufficient pediatric experience precludes recommendation for this age group.
0	To reconstitute the dry material, add 50 mL of 5 percent Dextrose Injection, or Sodium Chloride Injection to the vial.
0	Occasionally, some 5 percent Dextrose Injection solutions may have a low pH (below 5).
0	The resulting solution with such a diluent may be hazy or opalescent.
0	Intravenous use of such a solution is not recommended.
0	Inspect the vial containing Intravenous SODIUM EDECRIN for particulate matter and discoloration before use.
0	The solution may be given slowly through the tubing of a running infusion or by direct intravenous injection over a period of several minutes.
0	Do not mix this solution with whole blood or its derivatives.
0	Discard unused reconstituted solution after 24 hours.
0	SODIUM EDECRIN should not be given subcutaneously or intramuscularly because of local pain and irritation.
1	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
0	Read circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.
0	EDECRIN may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as aminoglycoside and some cephalosporin antibiotics.
1	A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.
0	In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.
0	Therefore, when EDECRIN and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.
0	Weakness, muscle cramps, paresthesias, thirst, anorexia, and signs of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and/or hypochloremic alkalosis may occur following vigorous or excessive diuresis and these may be accentuated by rigid salt restriction.
0	Rarely, tetany has been reported following vigorous diuresis.
0	During therapy with ethacrynic acid, liberalization of salt intake and supplementary potassium chloride are often necessary.
0	When a metabolic alkalosis may be anticipated, e.g., in cirrhosis with ascites, the use of potassium chloride or a potassium-sparing agent before and during therapy with EDECRIN may mitigate or prevent the hypokalemia.
0	Loop diuretics have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium; this may result in hypomagnesemia.
0	The safety and efficacy of ethacrynic acid in hypertension have not been established.
0	However, the dosage of coadministered antihypertensive agents may require adjustment.
0	Orthostatic hypotension may occur in patients receiving other antihypertensive agents when given ethacrynic acid.
0	EDECRIN has little or no effect on glomerular filtration or on renal blood flow, except following pronounced reductions in plasma volume when associated with rapid diuresis.
0	A transient increase in serum urea nitrogen may occur.
0	Usually, this is readily reversible when the drug is discontinued.
0	As with other diuretics used in the treatment of renal edema, hypoproteinemia may reduce responsiveness to ethacrynic acid and the use of salt-poor albumin should be considered.
0	EDECRIN may increase the risk of gastric hemorrhage associated with corticosteroid treatment.
0	Frequent serum electrolyte, CO2 and BUN determinations should be performed early in therapy and periodically thereafter during active diuresis.
0	Any electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected or the drug temporarily withdrawn.
0	Increases in blood glucose and alterations in glucose tolerance tests have been observed in patients receiving EDECRIN.
0	There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect in a 79-week oral chronic toxicity study in rats at doses up to 45 times the human dose.
0	Ethacrynic acid had no effect on fertility in a two-litter study in rats or a two-generation study in mice at 10 times the human dose.
0	Reproduction studies in the mouse and rabbit at doses up to 50 times the human dose showed no evidence of external abnormalities of the fetus due to EDECRIN.
0	In a two-litter study in the dog and rat, oral doses of 5 or 20 mg/kg/day (2<U+00BD> or 10 times the human dose), respectively, did not interfere with pregnancy or with growth and development of the pups.
0	Although there was reduction in the mean body weights of the fetuses in a teratogenic study in the rat at a dose level of 100 mg/kg (50 times the human dose), there was no effect on mortality or postnatal development.
0	Functional and morphologic abnormalities were not observed.
0	There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
0	Since animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, EDECRIN should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
0	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
0	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from EDECRIN, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
0	There are no well-controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients.
0	The information on oral dosing in pediatric patients, other than infants, is supported by evidence from empiric use in this age group.
0	For information on oral use in pediatric patients, other than infants, see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
0	Safety and effectiveness of oral and parenteral use in infants have not been established.
0	Safety and effectiveness of intravenous use in pediatric patients have not been established.
0	Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of EDECRIN/SODIUM EDECRIN, approximately 224 patients (21%) were 65 to 74 years of age, while approximately 100 patients (9%) were 75 years of age and over.
0	No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.
0	This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.
0	Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.
0	The effects of EDECRIN on electrolytes are related to its renal pharmacologic activity and are dose dependent.
0	The possibility of profound electrolyte and water loss may be avoided by weighing the patient throughout the treatment period, by careful adjustment of dosage, by initiating treatment with small doses, and by using the drug on an intermittent schedule when possible.
0	When excessive diuresis occurs, the drug should be withdrawn until homeostasis is restored.
0	When excessive electrolyte loss occurs, the dosage should be reduced or the drug temporarily withdrawn.
0	Initiation of diuretic therapy with EDECRIN in the cirrhotic patient with ascites is best carried out in the hospital.
0	When maintenance therapy has been established, the individual can be satisfactorily followed as an outpatient.
0	EDECRIN should be given with caution to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, particularly those with a history of previous episodes of electrolyte imbalance or hepatic encephalopathy.
0	Like other diuretics it may precipitate hepatic coma and death.
0	Too vigorous a diuresis, as evidenced by rapid and excessive weight loss, may induce an acute hypotensive episode.
0	In elderly cardiac patients, rapid contraction of plasma volume and the resultant hemoconcentration should be avoided to prevent the development of thromboembolic episodes, such as cerebral vascular thromboses and pulmonary emboli which may be fatal.
0	Excessive loss of potassium in patients receiving digitalis glycosides may precipitate digitalis toxicity.
0	Care should also be exercised in patients receiving potassium-depleting steroids.
0	A number of possibly drug-related deaths have occurred in critically ill patients refractory to other diuretics.
0	These generally have fallen into two categories: (1) patients with severe myocardial disease who have been receiving digitalis and presumably developed acute hypokalemia with fatal arrhythmia; (2) patients with severely decompensated hepatic cirrhosis with ascites, with or without accompanying encephalopathy, who were in electrolyte imbalance and died because of intensification of the electrolyte defect.
0	Deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo with a sense of fullness in the ears have occurred, most frequently in patients with severe impairment of renal function.
0	These symptoms have been associated most often with intravenous administration and with doses in excess of those recommended.
0	The deafness has usually been reversible and of short duration (one to 24 hours).
0	However, in some patients the hearing loss has been permanent.
0	A number of these patients were also receiving drugs known to be ototoxic.
0	EDECRIN may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs.
0	Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics.
0	EDECRIN acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and on the proximal and distal tubules.
0	Urinary output is usually dose dependent and related to the magnitude of fluid accumulation.
0	Water and electrolyte excretion may be increased several times over that observed with thiazide diuretics, since EDECRIN inhibits reabsorption of a much greater proportion of filtered sodium than most other diuretic agents.
0	Therefore, EDECRIN is effective in many patients who have significant degrees of renal insufficiency.
0	The electrolyte excretion pattern of ethacrynic acid varies from that of the thiazides and mercurial diuretics.
0	Initial sodium and chloride excretion is usually substantial and chloride loss exceeds that of sodium.
0	With prolonged administration, chloride excretion declines, and potassium and hydrogen ion excretion may increase.
0	EDECRIN is effective whether or not there is clinical acidosis or alkalosis.
0	Although EDECRIN, in carefully controlled studies in animals and experimental subjects, produces a more favorable sodium/potassium excretion ratio than the thiazides, in patients with increased diuresis excessive amounts of potassium may be excreted.
0	Onset of action is rapid, usually within 30 minutes after an oral dose of EDECRIN or within 5 minutes after an intravenous injection of SODIUM EDECRIN.
0	After oral use, diuresis peaks in about 2 hours and lasts about 6 to 8 hours.
0	The sulfhydryl binding propensity of ethacrynic acid differs somewhat from that of the organomercurials.
0	Its mode of action is not by carbonic anhydrase inhibition.
0	Ethacrynic acid does not cross the blood-brain barrier.
0	SERIOUS INFECTIONS Patients treated with Enbrel are at increased risk for developing serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or death.
0	Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.
0	Enbrel should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis.
0	Reported infections include: Active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent tuberculosis.
0	Patients with tuberculosis have frequently presented with disseminated or extrapulmonary disease.
0	Patients should be tested for latent tuberculosis before Enbrel use and during therapy.
0	Treatment for latent infection should be initiated prior to Enbrel use.
0	Invasive fungal infections, including histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, candidiasis, aspergillosis, blastomycosis, and pneumocystosis.
0	Patients with histoplasmosis or other invasive fungal infections may present with disseminated, rather than localized, disease.
0	Antigen and antibody testing for histoplasmosis may be negative in some patients with active infection.
0	Empiric anti-fungal therapy should be considered in patients at risk for invasive fungal infections who develop severe systemic illness.
0	Bacterial, viral, and other infections due to opportunistic pathogens, including Legionella and Listeria.
0	The risks and benefits of treatment with Enbrel should be carefully considered prior to initiating therapy in patients with chronic or recurrent infection.
0	Patients should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with Enbrel, including the possible development of tuberculosis in patients who tested negative for latent tuberculosis infection prior to initiating therapy.
0	MALIGNANCIES Lymphoma and other malignancies, some fatal, have been reported in children and adolescent patients treated with TNF blockers, including Enbrel.
0	WARNING : SERIOUS INFECTIONS and MALIGNANCIES See f ull p rescribing i nformation for complete b oxed w arning.

0	When using the Enbrel single-dose prefilled syringe, check to see if the amount of liquid in the prefilled syringe falls between the two purple fill level indicator lines on the syringe.
0	If the syringe does not have the right amount of liquid, DO NOT USE THAT SYRINGE.
0	Preparation of Enbrel Single- dose Prefilled SureClick Autoinjector Leave the autoinjector at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before injecting.
0	Preparation of E nbrel Lyophilized Powder in a Multiple- do se Vial Enbrel lyophilized powder should be reconstituted aseptically with 1 mL of the supplied Sterile Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP (0.9% benzyl alcohol), giving a solution of 1 mL containing 25 mg of Enbrel.
0	A vial adapter is supplied for use when reconstituting the lyophilized powder.
0	However, the vial adapter should not be used if multiple doses are going to be withdrawn from the vial.
0	If the vial will be used for multiple doses, a 25-gauge needle should be used for reconstituting and withdrawing Enbrel, and the supplied <U+201C>Mixing Date:<U+201D> sticker should be attached to the vial and the date of reconstitution entered.
0	Reconstituted solution must be refrigerated at 36<U+00B0>F to 46<U+00B0>F (2<U+00B0>C to 8<U+00B0>C) and used within 14 days.

0	Two distinct receptors for TNF (TNFRs), a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75), exist naturally as monomeric molecules on cell surfaces and in soluble forms.
0	Biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface TNFR.
0	Etanercept is a dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind TNF molecules.
0	Etanercept inhibits binding of TNF-<U+03B1> and TNF-<U+03B2> (lymphotoxin alpha [LT-<U+03B1>]) to cell surface TNFRs, rendering TNF biologically inactive.
0	In in v itro studies, large complexes of etanercept with TNF-<U+03B1> were not detected and cells expressing transmembrane TNF (that binds Enbrel) are not lysed in the presence or absence of complement.
0	Etanercept can modulate biological responses that are induced or regulated by TNF, including expression of adhesion molecules responsible for leukocyte migration (eg, E-selectin, and to a lesser extent, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]), serum levels of cytokines (eg, IL-6), and serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3 or stromelysin).

0	The use of tinidazole in pregnant patients has not been studied for bacterial vaginosis.
0	Tinidazole, like metronidazole, may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and hexokinase glucose.
0	All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +<U+2194> NADH).
0	Potential interference is due to the similarity of absorbance peaks of NADH and tinidazole.
0	Tinidazole, like metronidazole, may produce transient leukopenia and neutropenia; however, no persistent hematological abnormalities attributable to tinidazole have been observed in clinical studies.
0	Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended if re-treatment is necessary.
0	Although not specifically identified in studies with tinidazole, the following drug interactions were reported for metronidazole, a chemically-related nitroimidazole.
0	Therefore, these drug interactions may occur with tinidazole.
0	The following drug interactions were reported for metronidazole, a chemically-related nitroimidazole and may therefore occur with tinidazole: Warfarin and other oral coumarin anticoagulants: Anticoagulant dosage may need adjustment during and up to 8 days after tinidazole therapy ( 7.1) Alcohol-containing beverages/preparations: Avoid during and up to 3 days after tinidazole therapy ( 7.1) Lithium: Monitor serum lithium concentrations ( 7.1) Cyclosporine, tacrolimus: Monitor for toxicities of these immunosuppressive drugs ( 7.1) Fluorouracil: Monitor for fluorouracil-associated toxicities ( 7.1) Phenytoin, fosphenytoin: Adjustment of anticonvulsant and/or tinidazole dose(s) may be needed ( 7.1, 7.2) CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors: Monitor for decreased tinidazole effect or increased adverse reactions ( 7.2) Warfarin and Other Oral Coumarin Anticoagulants: As with metronidazole, tinidazole may enhance the effect of warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time.
0	The dosage of oral anticoagulants may need to be adjusted during tinidazole co-administration and up to 8 days after discontinuation.
0	Alcohols, Disulfiram: Alcoholic beverages and preparations containing ethanol or propylene glycol should be avoided during tinidazole therapy and for 3 days afterward because abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing may occur.
0	Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients using metronidazole and disulfiram concurrently.
0	Though no similar reactions have been reported with tinidazole, tinidazole should not be given to patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks.
1	Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels.
0	It is not known if tinidazole shares this property with metronidazole, but consideration should be given to measuring serum lithium and creatinine levels after several days of simultaneous lithium and tinidazole treatment to detect potential lithium intoxication.
1	Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin: Concomitant administration of oral metronidazole and intravenous phenytoin was reported to result in prolongation of the half-life and reduction in the clearance of phenytoin.
0	Metronidazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of orally-administered phenytoin.
1	Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus: There are several case reports suggesting that metronidazole has the potential to increase the levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus.
0	During tinidazole co-administration with either of these drugs, the patient should be monitored for signs of calcineurin-inhibitor associated toxicities.
0	Fluorouracil: Metronidazole was shown to decrease the clearance of fluorouracil, resulting in an increase in side-effects without an increase in therapeutic benefits.
0	If the concomitant use of tinidazole and fluorouracil cannot be avoided, the patient should be monitored for fluorouracil-associated toxicities.
1	CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and fosphenytoin (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole.
1	Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.
1	Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%.
0	Thus, it is advisable to separate dosing of cholestyramine and tinidazole to minimize any potential effect on the oral bioavailability of tinidazole.
0	Oxytetracycline: Oxytetracycline was reported to antagonize the therapeutic effect of metronidazole.

0	Treatment should not be continued longer than required to produce a cure with little or no risk or relapse of the disease.
0	Excessive blood levels may result from administration of the recommended dose to patients with impaired liver or kidney function.
0	The dosage should be adjusted accordingly, or preferably, the blood concentration should be determined at appropriate intervals.
0	The use of this antibiotic, as with other antibiotics, may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi.
0	If infections caused by nonsusceptible organisms appear during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.
0	Baseline blood studies should be followed by periodic blood studies approximately every two days during therapy.
0	The drug should be discontinued upon appearance of reticulocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia or any other blood study findings attributable to chloramphenicol.

0	See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for dosing information in the pediatric population.
0	Clinical studies of chloramphenicol sodium succinate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
0	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
0	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
0	This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.
0	Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.
0	Each gram (10 mL of a 10% solution) of chloramphenicol sodium succinate contains approximately 52 mg (2.25 mEq) of sodium.
0	Chloramphenicol administered orally is absorbed rapidly from the intestinal tract.
0	In controlled studies in adult volunteers using the recommended dosage of 50 mg/kg/day, a dosage of 1 g every 6 hours for 8 doses was given.
0	Using the microbiological assay method, the average peak serum level was 11.2 mcg/mL one hour after the first dose.

0	Total urinary excretion of chloramphenicol in these studies ranged from a low of 68% to a high of 99% over a three-day period.
0	From 8% to 12% of the antibiotic excreted is in the form of free chloramphenicol; the remainder consists of microbiologically inactive metabolites, principally the conjugate with glucuronic acid.
0	Since the glucuronide is excreted rapidly, most chloramphenicol detected in the blood is in the microbiologically active free form.
0	Despite the small proportion of unchanged drug excreted in the urine, the concentration of free chloramphenicol is relatively high, amounting to several hundred mcg/mL in patients receiving divided doses of 50 mg/kg/day.
0	Small amounts of active drug are found in bile and feces.
0	Chloramphenicol diffuses rapidly, but its distribution is not uniform.
0	Highest concentrations are found in liver and kidney, and lowest concentrations are found in brain and cerebrospinal fluid.
0	Chloramphenicol enters cerebrospinal fluid even in the absence of meningeal inflammation, appearing in concentrations about half of those found in the blood.
0	Measurable levels are also detected in pleural and in ascitic fluids, saliva, milk, and in the aqueous and vitreous humors.
0	Transport across the placental barrier occurs with somewhat lower concentration in cord blood of neonates than in maternal blood.
0	Mechanism of Action Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic originally isolated from Streptomyces venezuelae.
0	It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interfering with the transfer of activated amino acids from soluble RNA to ribosomes.

0	Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).
0	These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.
0	The MICs should be determined using a standardized (broth and/or agar).1,3 The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1.
0	Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.
0	The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method.2,3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg chloramphenicol to test the susceptibility of bacteria to chloramphenicol.

0	This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.
0	A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.
0	Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test.1,2,3 Standard chloramphenicol powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2.

0	Entacapone has no antiparkinsonian effect of its own.
1	In clinical studies, the majority of patients required a decrease in daily levodopa dose if their daily dose of levodopa had been greater than or equal to 800 mg or if patients had moderate or severe dyskinesia before beginning treatment.
1	To optimize an individual patient's response, reductions in daily levodopa dose or extending the interval between doses may be necessary.
1	In clinical studies, the average reduction in daily levodopa dose was about 25% in those patients requiring a levodopa dose reduction (more than 58% of patients with levodopa doses above 800 mg daily required such a reduction).
0	Comtan can be combined with both the immediate and sustained-release formulations of levodopa and carbidopa.
0	Comtan may be taken with or without food.
0	Patients with hepatic impairment should be treated with caution.
0	The AUC and Cmax of entacapone approximately doubled in patients with documented liver disease, compared to controls.
0	However, these studies were conducted with single-dose entacapone without levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration, and therefore the effects of liver disease on the kinetics of chronically administered entacapone have not been evaluated.
0	Rapid withdrawal or abrupt reduction in the Comtan dose could lead to emergence of signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and may lead to hyperpyrexia and confusion, a symptom complex resembling NMS.
0	This syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops a high fever or severe rigidity.
0	If a decision is made to discontinue treatment with Comtan, patients should be monitored closely and other dopaminergic treatments should be adjusted as needed.
0	Although tapering Comtan has not been systematically evaluated, it seems prudent to withdraw patients slowly if the decision to discontinue treatment is made.
0	In vitro studies of human CYP enzymes showed that entacapone inhibited the CYP enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A only at very high concentrations (IC50 from 200 microM to over 1,000 microM; an oral 200 mg dose achieves a highest level of approximately 5 microM in people); these enzymes would therefore not be expected to be inhibited in clinical use.
0	In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, entacapone did not significantly change the plasma levels of S-warfarin, while the AUC for R-warfarin increased on average by 18% [CI90 11% to 26%], and the international normalized ratio (INR) values increased on average by 13% [CI90 6% to 19%].
0	Nevertheless, cases of significantly increased INR in patients concomitantly using warfarin have been reported during the postapproval use of Comtan.
0	Therefore, monitoring of INR is recommended when entacapone treatment is initiated or when the dose is increased for patients receiving warfarin.
0	Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease patients has been associated with orthostatic hypotension.
0	Entacapone enhances levodopa bioavailability and, therefore, might be expected to increase the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension.
0	In controlled studies, approximately 1.2% and 0.8% of 200 mg entacapone and placebo patients, respectively, reported at least one episode of syncope.
0	Reports of syncope were generally more frequent in patients in both treatment groups who had an episode of documented hypotension.
0	Dopaminergic therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease has been associated with hallucinations.
0	In clinical studies, hallucinations led to drug discontinuation and premature withdrawal in 0.8% and 0% of patients treated with 200 mg Comtan and placebo, respectively.
0	Hallucinations led to hospitalization in 1.0% and 0.3% of patients in the 200 mg Comtan and placebo groups, respectively.
0	Agitation occurred in 1% of patients treated with Comtan and 0% treated with placebo.
0	Postmarketing reports indicate that patients may experience new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, which may be severe, including psychotic-like behavior during Comtan treatment or after starting or increasing the dose of Comtan.
0	Other drugs prescribed to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can have similar effects on thinking and behavior.
0	Abnormal thinking and behavior can cause paranoid ideation, delusions, hallucinations, confusion, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.
0	Psychotic-like behaviors were also observed during the clinical development of Comtan.
0	Patients with a major psychotic disorder should ordinarily not be treated with Comtan because of the risk of exacerbating psychosis.
0	In addition, certain medications used to treat psychosis may exacerbate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and may decrease the effectiveness of Comtan.
0	Postmarketing reports suggest that patients treated with anti-Parkinson medications can experience intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, and other intense urges.
0	Patients may be unable to control these urges while taking one or more of the medications that are used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and that increase central dopaminergic tone, including Comtan taken with levodopa and carbidopa.
0	In some cases, although not all, these urges were reported to have stopped when the dose of anti-Parkinson medications was reduced or discontinued.
0	Because patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal it is important for prescribers to specifically ask patients or their caregivers about the development of new or increased gambling urges, sexual urges, uncontrolled spending or other urges while being treated with entacapone.
0	Physicians should consider dose reduction or stopping Comtan if a patient develops such urges while taking Comtan.
0	In clinical studies, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10%) and 16 of 400 (4%) of patients treated with 200 mg Comtan and placebo, respectively.
0	In patients treated with Comtan, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%) but was regarded as severe in 1.3%.
0	Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea.
0	Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of Comtan.
0	Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized.
0	Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 weeks to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment.
0	Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia.
0	Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis.
0	In these cases, diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery, and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia.
0	In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when Comtan treatment was stopped.
0	In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of Comtan but recurred after retreatment with Comtan.
0	If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to Comtan, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered.
0	If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered.
0	Comtan may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia.
0	Although decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this side effect, many patients in controlled studies continued to experience frequent dyskinesia despite a reduction in their dose of levodopa.
0	The incidence of dyskinesia was 25% for treatment with Comtan and 15% for placebo.
0	The incidence of study withdrawal for dyskinesia was 1.5% for 200 mg Comtan and 0.8% for placebo.
0	The events listed below are events associated with the use of drugs that increase dopaminergic activity: Cases of severe rhabdomyolysis have been reported following the approval of Comtan.
0	Although the reactions typically occurred while patients were treated with Comtan, the complicated nature of these cases makes it difficult to determine what role, if any, Comtan played in their pathogenesis.
0	Severe prolonged motor activity including dyskinesia may account for rhabdomyolysis.
0	Signs and symptoms include fever, alteration of consciousness, myalgia, increased values of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and myoglobin.
0	Cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) characterized by elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and elevated CPK have been reported in association with the rapid dose reduction or withdrawal of other dopaminergic drugs.
0	In most of these cases, symptoms began after abrupt discontinuation of treatment with entacapone or reduction of its dose, or after the initiation of treatment with entacapone.
0	The complicated nature of these cases makes it difficult to determine what role, if any, Comtan may have played in their pathogenesis.
0	No cases have been reported following the abrupt withdrawal or dose reduction of entacapone treatment during clinical studies.
0	Prescribers should exercise caution when discontinuing entacapone treatment.
0	When considered necessary, withdrawal should proceed slowly.
0	If the decision is made to discontinue treatment with Comtan, recommendations include monitoring the patient closely and adjusting other dopaminergic treatments as needed.
0	Tapering Comtan has not been systematically evaluated.
0	Cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusion, and pleural thickening have been reported in some patients treated with ergot derived dopaminergic agents.
0	These complications may resolve when the drug is discontinued, but complete resolution does not always occur.
0	Although these adverse events are believed to be related to the ergoline structure of these compounds, whether other, nonergot derived drugs (e.g., entacapone) that increase dopaminergic activity can cause them is unknown.
0	It should be noted that the expected incidence of fibrotic complications is so low that even if entacapone caused these complications at rates similar to those attributable to other dopaminergic therapies, it is unlikely that it would have been detected in a cohort of the size exposed to entacapone.
0	Four cases of pulmonary fibrosis were reported during clinical development of entacapone; three of these patients were also treated with pergolide and one with bromocriptine.
0	The duration of treatment with entacapone ranged from 7 months to 17 months.
0	Epidemiological studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease have a higher risk (2- to approximately 6-fold higher) of developing melanoma than the general population.
0	Whether the increased risk observed was due to Parkinson's disease or other factors, such as drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, is unclear.
0	For the reasons stated above, patients and providers are advised to monitor for melanomas frequently and on a regular basis when using Comtan for any indication.
0	Ideally, periodic skin examinations should be performed by appropriately qualified individuals (e.g., dermatologists).
0	In a 1-year toxicity study, entacapone (plasma exposure 20 times that in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose of 1,600 mg) caused an increased incidence of nephrotoxicity in male rats that was characterized by regenerative tubules, thickening of basement membranes, infiltration of mononuclear cells, and tubular protein casts.
0	These effects were not associated with changes in clinical chemistry parameters, and there is no established method for monitoring for the possible occurrence of these lesions in humans.
0	Although this toxicity could represent a species-specific effect, there is not yet evidence that this is so.
0	The AUC and Cmax of entacapone approximately doubled in patients with documented liver disease compared to controls.
0	Instruct patients to take Comtan only as prescribed.
0	Inform patients that hallucinations and/or other psychotic-like behavior can occur.
0	Advise patients that they may develop postural (orthostatic) hypotension with or without symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, syncope, and sweating.
0	Hypotension may occur more frequently during initial therapy.
0	Accordingly, patients should be cautioned against rising rapidly after sitting or lying down, especially if they have been doing so for prolonged periods, and especially at the initiation of treatment with Comtan.
0	Advise patients that they should neither drive a car nor operate other complex machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on Comtan to gauge whether or not it affects their mental and/or motor performance adversely.
0	Warn patients about the possibility of sudden onset of sleep during daily activities, in some cases without awareness or warning signs, when they are taking dopaminergic agents, including Comtan.
0	Because of the possible additive sedative effects, caution should be used when patients are taking other CNS depressants in combination with Comtan.
0	Inform patients that nausea may occur, especially at the initiation of treatment with Comtan.
0	Inform patients that diarrhea may occur with Comtan and it may have a delayed onset.
0	Sometimes prolonged diarrhea may be caused by colitis (inflammation of the large intestine).
0	Patients with diarrhea should drink fluids to maintain adequate hydration and monitor for weight loss.
0	If diarrhea associated with Comtan is prolonged, discontinuing the drug is expected to lead to resolution, if diarrhea continues after stopping entacapone, further diagnostic investigations may be needed.
0	Advise patients about the possibility of an increase in dyskinesia.
0	Tell patients that treatment with entacapone may cause a change in the color of their urine (a brownish orange discoloration) that is not clinically relevant.
0	In controlled studies, 10% of patients treated with Comtan reported urine discoloration compared to 0% of placebo patients.
0	Although Comtan has not been shown to be teratogenic in animals, it is always given in conjunction with levodopa and carbidopa, which is known to cause visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits.
0	Accordingly, patients should be advised to notify their physicians if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy.
0	Entacapone is excreted into maternal milk in rats.
0	Because of the possibility that entacapone may be excreted into human maternal milk, advise patients to notify their physicians if they intend to breastfeed or are breastfeeding an infant.
0	Tell patients and family members to notify their healthcare practitioner if they notice that the patient develops unusual urges or behaviors.
0	The impact of entacapone on the body's iron stores is unknown; however, a tendency towards decreasing serum iron concentrations was noted in clinical studies.
0	In a controlled clinical study, serum ferritin levels (as marker of iron deficiency and subclinical anemia) were not changed with entacapone compared to placebo after one year of treatment and there was no difference in rates of anemia or decreased hemoglobin levels.
0	Entacapone is highly protein bound (98%).
0	In vitro studies have shown no binding displacement between entacapone and other highly bound drugs, such as warfarin, salicylic acid, phenylbutazone, and diazepam.
0	Levodopa is known to depress prolactin secretion and increase growth hormone levels.
0	Treatment with entacapone coadministered with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor does not change these effects.
0	See WARNINGS regarding concomitant use of Comtan and non-selective MAO inhibitors.
0	No interaction was noted with the MAO-B inhibitor selegiline in two multiple-dose interaction studies when entacapone was coadministered with a levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (n = 29).
0	More than 600 patients with Parkinson's disease in clinical studies have used selegiline in combination with entacapone and levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor.
0	As most entacapone excretion is via the bile, caution should be exercised when drugs known to interfere with biliary excretion, glucuronidation, and intestinal beta-glucuronidase are given concurrently with entacapone.
0	These include probenecid, cholestyramine, and some antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, rifampicin, ampicillin, and chloramphenicol).
0	No interaction with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine was shown in a single-dose study with entacapone without coadministered levodopa and dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor.
0	Two-year carcinogenicity studies of entacapone were conducted in mice and rats.
0	In mice, no increase in tumors was observed at oral doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day.
0	At the highest dose tested, plasma exposures (AUC) were 4 times higher than that in humans at the maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) of 1,600 mg.
0	In rats administered oral doses of 20, 90, or 400 mg/kg/day, an increased incidence of renal tubular adenomas and carcinomas was observed in males at the highest dose tested.
0	Plasma AUCs at the higher dose not associated with increased renal tumors (90 mg/kg/day) were approximately 5 times that in humans at the MRDD of entacapone.
0	The carcinogenic potential of entacapone administered in combination with levodopa and carbidopa has not been evaluated.
0	Entacapone was mutagenic and clastogenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma tk assay in the presence and absence of metabolic activation, and was clastogenic in cultured human lymphocytes in the presence of metabolic activation.
0	Entacapone, either alone or in combination with levodopa and carbidopa, was not clastogenic in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test or mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test).
0	Entacapone did not impair fertility or general reproductive performance in rats treated with up to 700 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 28 times those in humans receiving the MRDD of 1,600 mg).
0	Delayed mating, but no fertility impairment, was evident in female rats treated with 700 mg/kg/day of entacapone.
0	In embryo-fetal development studies, entacapone was administered to pregnant animals throughout organogenesis at doses of up to 1,000 mg/kg/day in rats and 300 mg/kg/day in rabbits.
0	Increased incidences of fetal variations were evident in litters from rats treated with the highest dose, in the absence of overt signs of maternal toxicity.
0	The maternal plasma drug exposure (AUC) associated with this dose was approximately 34 times the estimated plasma exposure in humans receiving the maximum recommended daily dose (MRDD) of 1,600 mg.
0	Increased frequencies of abortions, late and total resorptions, and decreased fetal weights were observed in the litters of rabbits treated with maternally toxic doses of 100 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 0.4 times those in humans receiving the MRDD) or greater.
0	There was no evidence of teratogenicity in these studies.
0	However, when entacapone was administered to female rats prior to mating and during early gestation, an increased incidence of fetal eye anomalies (macrophthalmia, microphthalmia, anophthalmia) was observed in the litters of dams treated with doses of 160 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 7 times those in humans receiving the MRDD) or greater, in the absence of maternal toxicity.
0	Administration of up to 700 mg/kg/day (plasma AUCs 28 times those in humans receiving the MRDD) to female rats during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation produced no evidence of developmental impairment in the offspring.
0	Entacapone is always given concomitantly with levodopa and carbidopa, which is known to cause visceral and skeletal malformations in rabbits.
0	The teratogenic potential of entacapone in combination with levodopa and carbidopa was not assessed in animals.
0	There is no experience from clinical studies regarding the use of Comtan in pregnant women.
0	Therefore, Comtan should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
0	In animal studies, entacapone was excreted into maternal rat milk.
0	It is not known whether entacapone is excreted in human milk.
0	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when entacapone is administered to a nursing woman.
0	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.
0	Monoamine oxidase (MAO) and COMT are the two major enzyme systems involved in the metabolism of catecholamines.
0	It is theoretically possible, therefore, that the combination of Comtan (entacapone) and a non-selective MAO inhibitor (e.g., phenelzine and tranylcypromine) would result in inhibition of the majority of the pathways responsible for normal catecholamine metabolism.
0	For this reason, patients should ordinarily not be treated concomitantly with Comtan and a non-selective MAO inhibitor.
0	Entacapone can be taken concomitantly with a selective MAO-B inhibitor (e.g., selegiline).
0	When a single 400 mg dose of entacapone was given with intravenous isoprenaline (isoproterenol) and epinephrine without coadministered levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, the overall mean maximal changes in heart rate during infusion were about 50% and 80% higher than with placebo, for isoprenaline and epinephrine, respectively.
0	Therefore, drugs known to be metabolized by COMT, such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, alpha-methyldopa, apomorphine, isoetherine, and bitolterol should be administered with caution in patients receiving entacapone regardless of the route of administration (including inhalation), as their interaction may result in increased heart rates, possible arrhythmias, and excessive changes in blood pressure.
0	Ventricular tachycardia was noted in one 32-year-old healthy male volunteer in an interaction study after epinephrine infusion and oral entacapone administration.
0	A causal relationship to entacapone administration appears probable but cannot be attributed with certainty.
0	Patients with Parkinson's disease treated with Comtan, which increases plasma levodopa levels, or with levodopa have reported suddenly falling asleep without prior warning of sleepiness while engaged in ADL (including the operation of motor vehicles).
0	Some of these episodes resulted in accidents.
0	Although many of these patients reported somnolence while on Comtan, some did not perceive warning signs, such as excessive drowsiness, and believed that they were alert immediately prior to the event.
0	Some of these events have been reported as late as one year after initiation of treatment.
0	The risk of somnolence was increased (Comtan 2% and placebo 0%) in controlled studies.
0	It has been reported that falling asleep while engaged in ADL always occurs in a setting of preexisting somnolence, although patients may not give such a history.
0	For this reason, prescribers should reassess patients for drowsiness or sleepiness especially since some of the events occur well after the start of treatment.
0	Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge drowsiness or sleepiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.
0	Patients should be advised to exercise caution while driving, operating machines, or working at heights during treatment with Comtan.
0	Patients who have already experienced somnolence and/or an episode of sudden sleep onset should not participate in these activities during treatment with Comtan.
0	Before initiating treatment with Comtan, advise patients of the potential to develop drowsiness and specifically ask about factors that may increase this risk such as concomitant use of sedating medications and the presence of sleep disorders.
0	If a patient develops daytime sleepiness or episodes of falling asleep during activities that require active participation (e.g., conversations, eating, etc.
0	), Comtan should ordinarily be discontinued.
0	If the decision is made to continue Comtan, patients should be advised not to drive and to avoid other potentially dangerous activities.
0	There is insufficient information to establish whether dose reduction will eliminate episodes of falling asleep while engaged in ADL.
0	Entacapone is a selective and reversible inhibitor of COMT.
0	In mammals, COMT is distributed throughout various organs with the highest activities in the liver and kidney.
0	COMT also occurs in the heart, lung, smooth and skeletal muscles, intestinal tract, reproductive organs, various glands, adipose tissue, skin, blood cells, and neuronal tissues, especially in glial cells.
0	COMT catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the phenolic group of substrates that contain a catechol structure.
0	Physiological substrates of COMT include dopa, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) and their hydroxylated metabolites.
0	The function of COMT is the elimination of biologically active catechols and some other hydroxylated metabolites.
0	In the presence of a decarboxylase inhibitor, COMT becomes the major metabolizing enzyme for levodopa, catalyzing the metabolism to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the brain and periphery.
0	The mechanism of action of entacapone is believed to be through its ability to inhibit COMT and alter the plasma pharmacokinetics of levodopa.
1	When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone.
1	It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to greater effects on the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
0	The higher levodopa levels also lead to increased levodopa adverse effects, sometimes requiring a decrease in the dose of levodopa.
0	In animals, while entacapone enters the central nervous system (CNS) to a minimal extent, it has been shown to inhibit central COMT activity.
0	In humans, entacapone inhibits the COMT enzyme in peripheral tissues.
0	The effects of entacapone on central COMT activity in humans have not been studied.
0	Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that entacapone reversibly inhibits human erythrocyte COMT activity after oral administration.
0	There was a linear correlation between entacapone dose and erythrocyte COMT inhibition, the maximum inhibition being 82% following an 800 mg single dose.
0	With a 200 mg single dose of entacapone, maximum inhibition of erythrocyte COMT activity is on average 65% with a return to baseline level within 8 hours.
1	When 200 mg entacapone is administered together with levodopa and carbidopa, it increases the area under the curve (AUC) of levodopa by approximately 35%, and the elimination half-life of levodopa is prolonged from 1.3 hours to 2.4 hours.
0	In general, the average peak levodopa plasma concentration and the time of its occurrence (Tmax of 1 hour) are unaffected.
0	The onset of effect occurs after the first administration and is maintained during long-term treatment.
0	Studies in Parkinson's disease patients suggest that the maximal effect occurs with 200 mg entacapone.
0	Plasma levels of 3-OMD are markedly and dose-dependently decreased by entacapone when given with levodopa and carbidopa.
0	Entacapone pharmacokinetics are linear over the dose range of 5 mg to 800 mg, and are independent of levodopa and carbidopa coadministration.
0	The elimination of entacapone is biphasic, with an elimination half-life of 0.4 hour to 0.7 hour based on the <U+03B2>-phase and 2.4 hours based on the <U+03B3>-phase.
0	The <U+03B3>-phase accounts for approximately 10% of the total AUC.
0	The total body clearance after intravenous administration is 850 mL per min.
0	After a single 200 mg dose of Comtan (entacapone), the Cmax is approximately 1.2 mcg per mL.
0	Entacapone is rapidly absorbed, with a Tmax of approximately 1 hour.
0	The absolute bioavailability following oral administration is 35%.
0	Food does not affect the pharmacokinetics of entacapone.
0	The volume of distribution of entacapone at steady state after intravenous injection is small (20 L).
0	Entacapone does not distribute widely into tissues due to its high plasma protein binding.
0	Based on in vitro studies, the plasma protein binding of entacapone is 98% over the concentration range of 0.4 mcg per mL to 50 mcg per mL.
0	Entacapone binds mainly to serum albumin.
0	Entacapone is almost completely metabolized prior to excretion, with only a very small amount (0.2% of dose) found unchanged in urine.
0	The main metabolic pathway is isomerization to the cis-isomer, followed by direct glucuronidation of the parent and cis-isomer; the glucuronide conjugate is inactive.
0	After oral administration of a 14C-labeled dose of entacapone, 10% of labeled parent and metabolite is excreted in urine and 90% in feces.
0	Entacapone pharmacokinetics are independent of age.
0	No formal gender studies have been conducted.
0	Racial representation in clinical studies was largely limited to Caucasians; therefore, no conclusions can be reached about the effect of Comtan on groups other than Caucasian.
0	A single 200 mg dose of entacapone, without levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration, showed approximately 2-fold higher AUC and Cmax values in patients with a history of alcoholism and hepatic impairment (n = 10) compared to normal subjects (n = 10).
0	All patients had biopsy-proven liver cirrhosis caused by alcohol.
0	According to Child-Pugh grading seven patients with liver disease had mild hepatic impairment and three patients had moderate hepatic impairment.
0	As only about 10% of the entacapone dose is excreted in urine as parent compound and conjugated glucuronide, biliary excretion appears to be the major route of excretion of this drug.
0	Consequently, entacapone should be administered with care to patients with biliary obstruction.
0	The pharmacokinetics of entacapone have been investigated after a single 200 mg entacapone dose, without levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor coadministration, in a specific renal impairment study.
0	There were three groups: normal subjects (n = 7; creatinine clearance greater than 1.12 mL per sec per 1.73 m2), moderate impairment (n = 10; creatinine clearance ranging from 0.60 mL per sec per 1.73 m2 to 0.89 mL per sec per 1.73 m2), and severe impairment (n = 7; creatinine clearance ranging from 0.20 mL per sec per 1.73 m2 to 0.44 mL per sec per 1.73 m2).
0	No important effects of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of entacapone were found.
0	The effectiveness of Comtan (entacapone) as an adjunct to levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease was established in three 24-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with Parkinson's disease.
0	In two of these studies, patients had motor fluctuations, characterized by documented periods of On (periods of relatively good functioning) and Off (periods of relatively poor functioning), despite optimum levodopa therapy.
0	There was also a withdrawal period following 6 months of treatment.
0	In the third study, patients were not required to have motor fluctuations.
0	Prior to the controlled part of the studies, patients were stabilized on levodopa for 2 weeks to 4 weeks.
0	Comtan has not been systematically evaluated in patients who have Parkinson's disease without motor fluctuations.
0	In the first two studies to be described, patients were randomized to receive placebo or entacapone 200 mg administered concomitantly with each dose of levodopa and carbidopa (up to 10 times daily, but averaging 4 doses to 6 doses per day).
0	The formal double-blind portion of both studies was 6 months long.
0	Patients recorded the time spent in the On and Off states in home diaries periodically throughout the duration of the study.
0	In one study, conducted in the Nordic countries, the primary outcome measure was the total mean time spent in the On state during an 18-hour diary recorded day (6 AM to midnight).
0	In the other study, the primary outcome measure was the proportion of awake time spent over 24 hours in the On state.
0	In addition to the primary outcome measure: the amount of time spent in the Off state, subparts of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) including mentation (Part I), activities of daily living (ADL) (Part II), motor function (Part III), complications of therapy (Part IV), and disease staging (Part V and VI) were assessed.
0	Additional secondary endpoints included the investigator's and patient's global assessment of clinical condition, a 7-point subjective scale designed to assess global functioning in Parkinson's disease; and the change in daily levodopa and carbidopa dose.
0	In one of the studies, 171 patients were randomized in 16 centers in Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark (Nordic study), all of whom received concomitant levodopa plus dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (either levodopa and carbidopa or levodopa and benserazide).
0	In the second study, 205 patients were randomized in 17 centers in North America (US and Canada); all patients received concomitant levodopa and carbidopa.

0	In the North American study, abrupt withdrawal of entacapone, without alteration of the dose of levodopa and carbidopa, resulted in a significant worsening of fluctuations, compared to placebo.
0	In some cases, symptoms were slightly worse than at baseline, but returned to approximately baseline severity within two weeks following levodopa dose increase on average by 80 mg.
0	In the Nordic study, similarly, a significant worsening of parkinsonian symptoms was observed after entacapone withdrawal, as assessed two weeks after drug withdrawal.
0	At this phase, the symptoms were approximately at baseline severity following levodopa dose increase by about 50 mg.
0	In the third placebo-controlled study, a total of 301 patients were randomized in 32 centers in Germany and Austria.
0	In this study, as in the other two studies, entacapone 200 mg was administered with each dose of levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (up to 10 times daily) and UPDRS Parts II and III and total daily On time were the primary measures of effectiveness.
0	The following results were observed for the primary measures, as well as for some secondary measures: Table 3.

0	GLUCOTROL is contraindicated in patients with: Known hypersensitivity to the drug.
0	Type 1 diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma.
0	This condition should be treated with insulin.
0	There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of diabetes mellitus with GLUCOTROL or any other hypoglycemic agent.
0	In addition to the usual monitoring of urinary glucose, the patient's blood glucose must also be monitored periodically to determine the minimum effective dose for the patient; to detect primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication; and to detect secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood-glucose-lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness.
0	Glycosylated hemoglobin levels may also be of value in monitoring the patient's response to therapy.
0	Short-term administration of GLUCOTROL may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually controlled well on diet.
0	In general, GLUCOTROL should be given approximately 30 minutes before a meal to achieve the greatest reduction in postprandial hyperglycemia.
0	The recommended starting dose is 5 mg, given before breakfast.
0	Geriatric patients or those with liver disease may be started on 2.5 mg.
0	Dosage adjustments should ordinarily be in increments of 2.5<U+2013>5 mg, as determined by blood glucose response.
0	At least several days should elapse between titration steps.
0	If response to a single dose is not satisfactory, dividing that dose may prove effective.
0	The maximum recommended once daily dose is 15 mg. Doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided and given before meals of adequate caloric content.
0	The maximum recommended total daily dose is 40 mg.
0	Some patients may be effectively controlled on a once-a-day regimen, while others show better response with divided dosing.
0	Total daily doses above 15 mg should ordinarily be divided.
0	Total daily doses above 30 mg have been safely given on a b.i.d. basis to long-term patients.
0	In elderly patients, debilitated or malnourished patients, and patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, the initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions.
0	As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, many stable non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients receiving insulin may be safely placed on GLUCOTROL.
0	When transferring patients from insulin to GLUCOTROL, the following general guidelines should be considered: For patients whose daily insulin requirement is 20 units or less, insulin may be discontinued and GLUCOTROL therapy may begin at usual dosages.
0	Several days should elapse between GLUCOTROL titration steps.
0	For patients whose daily insulin requirement is greater than 20 units, the insulin dose should be reduced by 50% and GLUCOTROL therapy may begin at usual dosages.
0	Subsequent reductions in insulin dosage should depend on individual patient response.
0	During the insulin withdrawal period, the patient should test urine samples for sugar and ketone bodies at least three times daily.
0	Patients should be instructed to contact the prescriber immediately if these tests are abnormal.
0	In some cases, especially when patient has been receiving greater than 40 units of insulin daily, it may be advisable to consider hospitalization during the transition period.
0	As with other sulfonylurea-class hypoglycemics, no transition period is necessary when transferring patients to GLUCOTROL.
0	Patients should be observed carefully (1<U+2013>2 weeks) for hypoglycemia when being transferred from longer half-life sulfonylureas (e.g., chlorpropamide) to GLUCOTROL due to potential overlapping of drug effect.
1	When colesevelam is coadministered with glipizide ER, maximum plasma concentration and total exposure to glipizide is reduced.
0	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam.
0	The hypoglycemic action of sulfonylureas may be potentiated by certain drugs including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, some azoles, and other drugs that are highly protein bound, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, quinolones and beta adrenergic blocking agents.
0	When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving GLUCOTROL, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.
0	When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving GLUCOTROL, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control.
0	In vitro binding studies with human serum proteins indicate that GLUCOTROL binds differently than tolbutamide and does not interact with salicylate or dicumarol.
0	However, caution must be exercised in extrapolating these findings to the clinical situation and in the use of GLUCOTROL with these drugs.
0	Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control.
0	These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid.
0	When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving GLUCOTROL, the patient should be closely observed for loss of control.
0	When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving GLUCOTROL, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia.
0	A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported.
0	Whether this interaction also occurs with the intravenous, topical, or vaginal preparations of miconazole is not known.
0	The effect of concomitant administration of DIFLUCAN<U+00AE> (fluconazole) and GLUCOTROL has been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled crossover study in normal volunteers.
0	All subjects received GLUCOTROL alone and following treatment with 100 mg of DIFLUCAN as a single daily oral dose for 7 days.
1	The mean percentage increase in the GLUCOTROL AUC after fluconazole administration was 56.9% (range: 35 to 81).
1	In studies assessing the effect of colesevelam on the pharmacokinetics of glipizide ER in healthy volunteers, reductions in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> and Cmax of 12% and 13%, respectively were observed when colesevelam was coadministered with glipizide ER.
0	When glipizide ER was administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam, there was no significant change in glipizide AUC0<U+2013><U+221E> or Cmax, -4% and 0%, respectively.
1	Therefore, GLUCOTROL should be administered at least 4 hours prior to colesevelam to ensure that colesevelam does not reduce the absorption of glipizide.
0	There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with GLUCOTROL or any other anti-diabetic drug.
0	The metabolism and excretion of GLUCOTROL may be slowed in patients with impaired renal and/or hepatic function.
0	If hypoglycemia should occur in such patients, it may be prolonged and appropriate management should be instituted.
0	All sulfonylurea drugs are capable of producing severe hypoglycemia.
0	Proper patient selection, dosage, and instructions are important to avoid hypoglycemic episodes.
0	Renal or hepatic insufficiency may cause elevated blood levels of GLUCOTROL and the latter may also diminish gluconeogenic capacity, both of which increase the risk of serious hypoglycemic reactions.
0	Elderly, debilitated or malnourished patients, and those with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, are particularly susceptible to the hypoglycemic action of glucose-lowering drugs.
0	Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly, and in people who are taking beta-adrenergic blocking drugs.
0	Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur when caloric intake is deficient, after severe or prolonged exercise, when alcohol is ingested, or when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used.
0	When a patient stabilized on any diabetic regimen is exposed to stress such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery, a loss of control may occur.
0	At such times, it may be necessary to discontinue GLUCOTROL and administer insulin.
0	The effectiveness of any oral hypoglycemic drug, including GLUCOTROL, in lowering blood glucose to a desired level decreases in many patients over a period of time, which may be due to progression of the severity of the diabetes or to diminished responsiveness to the drug.
0	This phenomenon is known as secondary failure, to distinguish it from primary failure in which the drug is ineffective in an individual patient when first given.
0	Treatment of patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with sulfonylurea agents can lead to hemolytic anemia.
0	Because GLUCOTROL belongs to the class of sulfonylurea agents, caution should be used in patients with G6PD deficiency and a non-sulfonylurea alternative should be considered.
0	In post-marketing reports, hemolytic anemia has also been reported in patients who did not have known G6PD deficiency.
0	Blood and urine glucose should be monitored periodically.
0	Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin may be useful.
0	Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of GLUCOTROL and of alternative modes of therapy.
0	They should also be informed about the importance of adhering to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of urine and/or blood glucose.
0	The risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members.
0	Primary and secondary failure should also be explained.
0	In initiating treatment for type 2 diabetes, diet should be emphasized as the primary form of treatment.
0	Caloric restriction and weight loss are essential in the obese diabetic patient.
0	Proper dietary management alone may be effective in controlling the blood glucose and symptoms of hyperglycemia.
0	The importance of regular physical activity should also be stressed, and cardiovascular risk factors should be identified and corrective measures taken where possible.
0	Use of GLUCOTROL or other antidiabetic medications must be viewed by both the physician and patient as a treatment in addition to diet and not as a substitution or as a convenient mechanism for avoiding dietary restraint.
0	Furthermore, loss of blood glucose control on diet alone may be transient, thus requiring only short-term administration of GLUCOTROL or other antidiabetic medications.
0	Maintenance or discontinuation of GLUCOTROL or other antidiabetic medications should be based on clinical judgment using regular clinical and laboratory evaluations.
0	A twenty month study in rats and an eighteen month study in mice at doses up to 75 times the maximum human dose revealed no evidence of drug-related carcinogenicity.
0	Bacterial and in vivo mutagenicity tests were uniformly negative.
0	Studies in rats of both sexes at doses up to 75 times the human dose showed no effects on fertility.
0	GLUCOTROL (glipizide) was found to be mildly fetotoxic in rat reproductive studies at all dose levels (5<U+2013>50 mg/kg).
0	This fetotoxicity has been similarly noted with other sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and tolazamide.
0	The effect is perinatal and believed to be directly related to the pharmacologic (hypoglycemic) action of GLUCOTROL.
0	In studies in rats and rabbits, no teratogenic effects were found.
0	There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.
0	GLUCOTROL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
0	Because recent information suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities, many experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.
0	Prolonged severe hypoglycemia (4 to 10 days) has been reported in neonates born to mothers who were receiving a sulfonylurea drug at the time of delivery.
0	This has been reported more frequently with the use of agents with prolonged half-lives.
0	If GLUCOTROL is used during pregnancy, it should be discontinued at least one month before the expected delivery date.
0	Although it is not known whether GLUCOTROL is excreted in human milk, some sulfonylurea drugs are known to be excreted in human milk.
0	Because the potential for hypoglycemia in nursing infants may exist, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.
0	If the drug is discontinued and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.
0	Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.
0	A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of GLUCOTROL included sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects.
0	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
0	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
0	The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin.
0	This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
0	The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (Diabetes, 19, supp.
0	UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2<U+00BD> times that of patients treated with diet alone.
0	A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality.
0	Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning.
0	The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of GLUCOTROL and of alternative modes of therapy.
0	Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure.
0	The primary mode of action of GLUCOTROL in experimental animals appears to be the stimulation of insulin secretion from the beta cells of pancreatic islet tissue and is thus dependent on functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets.
0	In humans, GLUCOTROL appears to lower the blood glucose acutely by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets.
0	The mechanism by which GLUCOTROL lowers blood glucose during long-term administration has not been clearly established.
0	In man, stimulation of insulin secretion by GLUCOTROL in response to a meal is undoubtedly of major importance.
0	Fasting insulin levels are not elevated even on long-term GLUCOTROL administration, but the postprandial insulin response continues to be enhanced after at least 6 months of treatment.
0	The insulinotropic response to a meal occurs within 30 minutes after an oral dose of GLUCOTROL in diabetic patients, but elevated insulin levels do not persist beyond the time of the meal challenge.
0	Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.
0	Blood sugar control persists in some patients for up to 24 hours after a single dose of GLUCOTROL, even though plasma levels have declined to a small fraction of peak levels by that time.
0	Some patients fail to respond initially, or gradually lose their responsiveness to sulfonylurea drugs, including GLUCOTROL.
0	Alternatively, GLUCOTROL may be effective in some patients who have not responded or have ceased to respond to other sulfonylureas.
0	It has been shown that GLUCOTROL therapy was effective in controlling blood sugar without deleterious changes in the plasma lipoprotein profiles of patients treated for NIDDM.
0	In a placebo-controlled, crossover study in normal volunteers, GLUCOTROL had no antidiuretic activity and, in fact, led to a slight increase in free water clearance.
0	Gastrointestinal absorption of GLUCOTROL in man is uniform, rapid, and essentially complete.
0	Peak plasma concentrations occur 1<U+2013>3 hours after a single oral dose.
0	The half-life of elimination ranges from 2<U+2013>4 hours in normal subjects, whether given intravenously or orally.
0	The metabolic and excretory patterns are similar with the two routes of administration, indicating that first-pass metabolism is not significant.
0	GLUCOTROL does not accumulate in plasma on repeated oral administration.
1	Total absorption and disposition of an oral dose was unaffected by food in normal volunteers, but absorption was delayed by about 40 minutes.
0	Thus, GLUCOTROL was more effective when administered about 30 minutes before, rather than with, a test meal in diabetic patients.
0	Protein binding was studied in serum from volunteers who received either oral or intravenous GLUCOTROL and found to be 98<U+2013>99% one hour after either route of administration.
0	The apparent volume of distribution of GLUCOTROL after intravenous administration was 11 liters, indicative of localization within the extracellular fluid compartment.
0	In mice, no GLUCOTROL or metabolites were detectable autoradiographically in the brain or spinal cord of males or females, nor in the fetuses of pregnant females.
0	In another study, however, very small amounts of radioactivity were detected in the fetuses of rats given labelled drug.
0	The metabolism of GLUCOTROL is extensive and occurs mainly in the liver.
0	The primary metabolites are inactive hydroxylation products and polar conjugates and are excreted mainly in the urine.
0	Less than 10% unchanged GLUCOTROL is found in the urine.
0	HUMULIN R is contraindicated: during episodes of hypoglycemia in patients with hypersensitivity to HUMULIN R or any of its excipients.
0	Do not use during episodes of hypoglycemia.

0	Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy.
0	Intravenous Administration Administer HUMULIN R intravenously ONLY under medical supervision with close monitoring of blood glucose and potassium levels to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia and hypokalemia.
0	For intravenous use, HUMULIN R should be used at concentrations from 0.1 unit/mL to 1 unit/mL in infusion systems containing 0.9% sodium chloride.
0	Individualize and adjust the dosage of HUMULIN R based on the route of administration, the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic control goal.
0	Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity, changes in meal patterns (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of food intake), changes in renal or hepatic function, or during acute illness.
0	Dosage adjustment may be needed when switching from another insulin to HUMULIN R.

0	Hypokalemia: May be life-threatening.
0	Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia and treat if indicated.
0	Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs.
0	Patients using HUMULIN R vials must never share needles or syringes with another person.
0	Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood-borne pathogens.
0	Changes in insulin, manufacturer, type, or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
0	These changes should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased.
0	For patients with type 2 diabetes, adjustments in concomitant anti-diabetic medications may be needed.
0	Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulins, including HUMULIN R. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures, may lead to unconsciousness, may be life threatening or cause death.
0	Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important (e.g., driving or operating other machinery).
0	Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual.
0	Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes, in patients with diabetic nerve disease, in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., beta-blockers), or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia.
0	Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and, in general, is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal.
0	As with all insulin preparations, the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMULIN R may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions, including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature.
0	Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern (e.g., macronutrient content or timing of meals), changes in level of physical activity, or changes to co-administered medication.
0	Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia.
0	Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia.
0	Self-monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia.
0	In patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia, increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended.
0	Accidental mix-ups between HUMULIN R and other insulins have been reported.
0	To avoid medication errors between HUMULIN R and other insulins, instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection.
0	Severe, life-threatening, generalized allergy, including anaphylaxis, can occur with HUMULIN R.
0	If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue HUMULIN R; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve.
0	HUMULIN R is contraindicated in patients who have had a hypersensitivity reaction to HUMULIN R or its excipients.
0	All insulin products, including HUMULIN R, cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space, possibly leading to hypokalemia.
0	Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis, ventricular arrhythmia, and death.
0	Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated (e.g., patients using potassium-lowering medications, patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations).
0	Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin.
0	Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure.
0	Patients treated with insulin, including HUMULIN R, and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure.
0	If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.
0	The primary activity of insulin, including HUMULIN R, is the regulation of glucose metabolism.
0	Insulin lowers blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production.
0	Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis.
0	The time course of insulin action (i.e., glucose lowering) may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual.
0	With subcutaneous use, the pharmacologic effect of HUMULIN R begins approximately 30 minutes (range: 10 to 75 minutes) after administration of doses in the 0.05 to 0.4 units/kg range (Figure 1).
0	The effect is maximal at approximately 3 hours (range: 20 minutes to 7 hours) and terminates after approximately 8 hours (range: 3 to 14 hours).

0	Read the cautionary statement and confirm that you have selected the correct medication and strength.
0	When heparin is added to an infusion solution for continuous intravenous administration, the container should be inverted at least six times to ensure adequate mixing and prevent pooling of the heparin in the solution.
0	Heparin sodium is not effective by oral administration and should be given by intermittent intravenous injection, intravenous infusion, or deep subcutaneous (intrafat, i.e., above the iliac crest or abdominal fat layer) injection.
0	The intramuscular route of administration should be avoided because of the frequent occurrence of hematoma at the injection site.
0	The dosage of heparin sodium should be adjusted according to the patient's coagulation-test results.
0	When heparin is given by continuous intravenous infusion, the coagulation time should be determined approximately every 4 hours in the early stages of treatment.
0	When the drug is administered intermittently by intravenous injection, coagulation tests should be performed before each injection during the early stages of treatment and at appropriate intervals thereafter.
0	Dosage is considered adequate when the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is 1.5 to 2 times normal or when the whole blood clotting time is elevated approximately 2.5 to 3 times the control value.
0	After deep subcutaneous (intrafat) injections, tests for adequacy of dosage are best performed on samples drawn 4 to 6 hours after the injection.
0	Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration.
0	Converting to Oral Anticoagulant When an oral anticoagulant of the coumarin or similar type is to be begun in patients already receiving heparin sodium, baseline and subsequent tests of prothrombin activity must be determined at a time when heparin activity is too low to affect the prothrombin time.
0	This is about 5 hours after the last intravenous bolus and 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose.
0	If continuous intravenous heparin infusion is used, prothrombin time can usually be measured at any time.
0	In converting from heparin to an oral anticoagulant, the dose of the oral anticoagulant should be the usual initial amount and thereafter prothrombin time should be determined at the usual intervals.
0	To ensure continuous anticoagulation, it is advisable to continue full heparin therapy for several days after the prothrombin time has reached the therapeutic range.
0	Heparin therapy may then be discontinued without tapering.
0	Therapeutic Anticoagulant Effect With Full-Dose Heparin Although dosage must be adjusted for the individual patient according to the results of suitable laboratory tests, the following dosage schedules may be used as guidelines: METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION FREQUENCY RECOMMENDED DOSE [based on 150 lb (68 kg) patient] Deep, Subcutaneous (Intrafat) Injection A different site should be used for each injection to prevent the development of massive hematoma.
0	Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection, followed by 10,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution, subcutaneously Every 8 hours or Every 12 hours 8,000 to 10,000 units of a concentrated solution 15,000 to 20,000 units of a concentrated solution Intermittent Intravenous Injection Initial dose 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 or 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Every 4 to 6 hours 5,000 to 10,000 units, either undiluted or in 50 to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP Intravenous Infusion Initial dose 5,000 units by intravenous injection Continuous 20,000 to 40,000 units/24 hours in 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or in any compatible solution) for infusion Pediatric Use Use preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection, USP in neonates and infants.
0	There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients.
0	Pediatric dosing recommendations are based on clinical experience.

0	Surgery of the Heart and Blood Vessels Patients undergoing total body perfusion for open-heart surgery should receive an initial dose of not less than 150 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight.
0	Frequently, a dose of 300 units of heparin sodium per kilogram of body weight is used for procedures estimated to last less than 60 minutes, or 400 units per kilogram for those estimated to last longer than 60 minutes.
0	Low-Dose Prophylaxis of Postoperative Thromboembolism A number of well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that low-dose heparin prophylaxis, given just prior to and after surgery, will reduce the incidence of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in the legs (as measured by the I-125 fibrinogen technique and venography) and of clinical pulmonary embolism.
0	The most widely used dosage has been 5,000 units 2 hours before surgery and 5,000 units every 8 to 12 hours thereafter for 7 days or until the patient is fully ambulatory, whichever is longer.
0	The heparin is given by deep subcutaneous injection in the arm or abdomen with a fine needle (25 to 26 gauge) to minimize tissue trauma.
0	A concentrated solution of heparin sodium is recommended.
0	Such prophylaxis should be reserved for patients over the age of 40 who are undergoing major surgery.
0	Patients with bleeding disorders and those having neurosurgery, spinal anesthesia, eye surgery or potentially sanguineous operations should be excluded, as should patients receiving oral anticoagulants or platelet-active drugs.
0	The value of such prophylaxis in hip surgery has not been established.
0	The possibility of increased bleeding during surgery or postoperatively should be borne in mind.
0	If such bleeding occurs, discontinuance of heparin and neutralization with protamine sulfate is advisable.
0	If clinical evidence of thromboembolism develops despite low-dose prophylaxis, full therapeutic doses of anticoagulants should be given unless contraindicated.
0	All patients should be screened prior to heparinization to rule out bleeding disorders, and monitoring should be performed with appropriate coagulation tests just prior to surgery.
0	Coagulation test values should be normal or only slightly elevated.
0	There is usually no need for daily monitoring of the effect of low-dose heparin in patients with normal coagulation parameters.
0	Extracorporeal Dialysis Follow equipment manufacturers' operating directions carefully.
0	Blood Transfusion Addition of 400 to 600 USP units per 100 mL of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation.
0	Usually, 7,500 USP units of heparin sodium are added to 100 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (or 75,000 USP units per 1,000 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) and mixed; from this sterile solution, 6 mL to 8 mL are added per 100 mL of whole blood.
0	Laboratory Samples Addition of 70 to 150 units of heparin sodium per 10 to 20 mL sample of whole blood is usually employed to prevent coagulation of the sample.
0	Leukocyte counts should be performed on heparinized blood within two hours after addition of the heparin.
0	Heparinized blood should not be used for isoagglutinin, complement, or erythrocyte fragility tests or platelet counts.
0	NOTE: To prevent needle-stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent, or broken by hand.

0	Increased Risk to Older Patients, Especially Women A higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age.
0	Laboratory Tests Periodic platelet counts, hematocrits, and tests for occult blood in stool are recommended during the entire course of heparin therapy, regardless of the route of administration.
0	Drug Interactions Oral Anticoagulants Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time.
0	Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.
0	Platelet Inhibitors Drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, dextran, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, indomethacin, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium.
0	Other Interactions Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium.
0	Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin.
0	Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.
0	Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Hyperaminotransferasemia Significant elevations of aminotransferase (SGOT [S-AST] and SGPT [S-ALT]) levels have occurred in a high percentage of patients (and healthy subjects) who have received heparin.
0	Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction, liver disease and pulmonary emboli, increases that might be caused by drugs (like heparin) should be interpreted with caution.
0	Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential of heparin.
0	Also, no reproduction studies in animals have been performed concerning mutagenesis or impairment of fertility.
0	Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on heparin use in pregnant women.
0	In published reports, heparin exposure during pregnancy did not show evidence of an increased risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in humans.
0	Heparin sodium does not cross the placenta based on human and animal studies.
0	Administration of heparin to pregnant animals at doses higher than the maximum human daily dose based on body weight resulted in increased resorptions.
0	Use heparin sodium during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
0	If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during pregnancy.
0	There are no known adverse outcomes associated with fetal exposure to the preservative benzyl alcohol through maternal drug administration; however, the preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administered intravenously to neonates and infants.
0	In a published study conducted in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received heparin intravenously during organogenesis at a dose of 10,000 units/kg/day, approximately 10 times the maximum human daily dose based on body weight.
0	The number of early resorptions increased in both species.
0	There was no evidence of teratogenic effects.
0	Nursing Mothers If available, preservative-free Heparin Sodium Injection is recommended when heparin therapy is needed during lactation.
0	Due to its large molecular weight, heparin is not likely to be excreted in human milk, and any heparin in milk would not be orally absorbed by a nursing infant.
0	Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant.
0	Exercise caution when administering Heparin Sodium Injection, USP to a nursing mother.
0	Pediatric Use There are no adequate and well controlled studies on heparin use in pediatric patients.
0	Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug.

0	The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients.
0	The gasping syndrome (characterized by central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, gasping respirations, and high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites found in the blood and urine) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages >99 mg/kg/day in neonates and low-birth weight infants.
0	Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration, seizures, intracranial hemorrhage, hematologic abnormalities, skin breakdown, hepatic and renal failure, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse.
0	Although normal therapeutic doses of this product deliver amounts of benzyl alcohol that are substantially lower than those reported in association with the gasping syndrome, the minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known.
0	Premature and low-birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity.

0	Hypersensitivity Patients with documented hypersensitivity to heparin should be given the drug only in clearly life-threatening situations.
0	Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur at virtually any site in patients receiving heparin.
0	An unexplained fall in hematocrit, fall in blood pressure or any other unexplained symptom should lead to serious consideration of a hemorrhagic event.
0	Heparin sodium should be used with extreme caution in disease states in which there is increased danger of hemorrhage.
0	Some of the conditions in which increased danger of hemorrhage exists are: Cardiovascular <U+2014> Subacute bacterial endocarditis, severe hypertension.

0	Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of up to 30%.
0	Platelet counts should be obtained at baseline and periodically during heparin administration.
0	Mild thrombocytopenia (count greater than 100,000/mm3) may remain stable or reverse even if heparin is continued.
0	However, thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely.
0	If the count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops With or Without Thrombosis ), the heparin product should be discontinued and, if necessary, an alternative anticoagulant administered.
0	Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) (With or Without Thrombosis) HIT is a serious immune-mediated reaction resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets.
0	HIT may progress to the development of venous and arterial thromboses, a condition referred to as HIT with thrombosis.
0	Thrombotic events may also be the initial presentation for HIT.
0	These serious thromboembolic events include deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, mesenteric thrombosis, renal arterial thrombosis, skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, and fatal outcomes.
0	Once HIT (with or without thrombosis) is diagnosed or strongly suspected, all heparin sodium sources (including heparin flushes) should be discontinued and an alternative anticoagulant used.
0	Future use of heparin sodium, especially within 3 to 6 months following the diagnosis of HIT (with or without thrombosis), and while patients test positive for HIT antibodies, should be avoided.
0	Immune-mediated HIT is diagnosed based on clinical findings supplemented by laboratory tests confirming the presence of antibodies to heparin sodium, or platelet activation induced by heparin sodium.
0	A drop in platelet count greater than 50% from baseline is considered indicative of HIT.
0	Platelet counts begin to fall 5 to 10 days after exposure to heparin sodium in heparin sodium-na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve individuals, and reach a threshold by days 7 to 14.
0	In contrast, rapid onset HIT can occur very quickly (within 24 hours following heparin sodium initiation), especially in patients with a recent exposure to heparin sodium (i.e. previous 3 months).
0	Thrombosis development shortly after documenting thrombocytopenia is a characteristic finding in almost half of all patients with HIT.
0	Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely.
0	If the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3 or if recurrent thrombosis develops, the heparin product should be promptly discontinued and alternative anticoagulants considered if patients require continued anticoagulation.
0	Delayed Onset of HIT (With or Without Thrombosis) Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (with or without thrombosis) can occur up to several weeks after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.
0	Patients presenting with thrombocytopenia or thrombosis after discontinuation of heparin sodium should be evaluated for HIT (with or without thrombosis).
0	Use in Neonates Heparin Sodium Injection, USP 5,000 units/mL contains the preservative benzyl alcohol and is not recommended for use in neonates.
0	There have been reports of fatal 'gasping syndrome' in neonates (children less than one month of age) following the administration of intravenous solutions containing the preservative benzyl alcohol.
0	Symptoms include a striking onset of gasping respiration, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiovascular collapse.
0	Carefully examine all Heparin Sodium Injection vials and cartridges to confirm choice of the correct strength prior to administration of the drug.
0	Pediatric patients, including neonates, have died as a result of medication errors in which Heparin Sodium Injection vials have been confused with catheter lock flush vials.
0	Heparin inhibits reactions that lead to the clotting of blood and the formation of fibrin clots both in vitro and in vivo.
0	Heparin acts at multiple sites in the normal coagulation system.
0	Small amounts of heparin in combination with antithrombin III (heparin cofactor) can inhibit thrombosis by inactivating activated Factor X and inhibiting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin.
0	Once active thrombosis has developed, larger amounts of heparin can inhibit further coagulation by inactivating thrombin and preventing the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin.
0	Heparin also prevents the formation of a stable fibrin clot by inhibiting the activation of the fibrin stabilizing factor.
0	Bleeding time is usually unaffected by heparin.
0	Clotting time is prolonged by full therapeutic doses of heparin; in most cases, it is not measurably affected by low doses of heparin.
0	Patients over 60 years of age, following similar doses of heparin, may have higher plasma levels of heparin and longer activated partial thromboplastin times (APTTs) compared with patients under 60 years of age.
0	Peak plasma levels of heparin are achieved 2 to 4 hours following subcutaneous administration, although there are considerable individual variations.
0	Loglinear plots of heparin plasma concentrations with time, for a wide range of dose levels, are linear, which suggests the absence of zero order processes.
0	Liver and reticulo-endothelial system are the sites of biotransformation.
0	The biphasic elimination curve, a rapidly declining alpha phase (t1/2 = 10 min.
0	), and after the age of 40 a slower beta phase, indicates uptake in organs.
0	The absence of a relationship between anticoagulant half-life and concentration half-life may reflect factors such as protein binding of heparin.
0	Heparin does not have fibrinolytic activity; therefore, it will not lyse existing clots.
0	Contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, pyloric or duodenal obstruction, stenosing peptic ulcers, prostatic hypertrophy or obstruction of the bladder neck, cardio-spasm (megaesophagus) and myasthenia gravis.
0	Contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity to the drug.

1	Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) increase pioglitazone concentrations.
1	CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.
1	Topiramate may decrease pioglitazone concentrations.
1	An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone.
1	Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of ACTOS is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors.
1	An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone.
0	Therefore, if an inducer of CYP2C8 is started or stopped during treatment with ACTOS, changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based on clinical response without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 45 mg for ACTOS.
1	A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with concomitant administration of pioglitazone and topiramate.
0	The clinical relevance of this decrease is unknown; however, when ACTOS and topiramate are used concomitantly, monitor patients for adequate glycemic control.
0	Congestive heart failure: Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure.
0	Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk.
0	Hypoglycemia: When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.
0	Hepatic effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal.
0	If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt ACTOS and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization.
0	Do not restart ACTOS if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found.
0	Bladder cancer: May increase the risk of bladder cancer.
0	Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer.
0	Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.
0	Edema: Dose-related edema may occur.
0	Fractures: Increased incidence in female patients.
0	Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health.
0	Macular edema: Postmarketing reports.
0	Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes.
0	Macrovascular outcomes: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with ACTOS.
0	ACTOS, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when ACTOS is used in combination with insulin.
0	Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure.
0	Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure.
0	If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of ACTOS must be considered.
0	Patients receiving ACTOS in combination with insulin or other antidiabetic medications (particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas) may be at risk for hypoglycemia.
0	A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.
0	There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking ACTOS, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause.
0	There has been no evidence of drug-induced hepatotoxicity in the ACTOS controlled clinical trial database to date.
0	Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure, both of which may cause liver test abnormalities, and they may also have other forms of liver disease, many of which can be treated or managed.
0	Therefore, obtaining a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating ACTOS therapy.
0	In patients with abnormal liver tests, ACTOS should be initiated with caution.
0	Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice.
0	In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range), ACTOS treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause.
0	ACTOS should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities.
0	Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury, and should not be restarted on ACTOS.
0	For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with ACTOS can be used with caution.
0	Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two-year carcinogenicity study.
0	In addition, during the three year PROactive clinical trial, 14 patients out of 2605 (0.54%) randomized to ACTOS and 5 out of 2633 (0.19%) randomized to placebo were diagnosed with bladder cancer.
0	After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer, there were 6 (0.23%) cases on ACTOS and two (0.08%) cases on placebo.
0	After completion of the trial, a large subset of patients was observed for up to 10 additional years, with little additional exposure to ACTOS.
0	During the 13 years of both PROactive and observational follow-up, the occurrence of bladder cancer did not differ between patients randomized to ACTOS or placebo (HR =1.00; [95% CI: 0.59<U+2212>1.72]).
0	Findings regarding the risk of bladder cancer in patients exposed to ACTOS vary among observational studies; some did not find an increased risk of bladder cancer associated with ACTOS, while others did.
0	A large prospective10-year observational cohort study conducted in the United States found no statistically significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer in diabetic patients ever exposed to ACTOS, compared to those never exposed to ACTOS (HR =1.06 [95% CI 0.89<U+2212>1.26]).
0	A retrospective cohort study conducted with data from the United Kingdom found a statistically significant association between ever exposure to ACTOS and bladder cancer (HR: 1.63; [95% CI: 1.22<U+2212>2.19]).
0	Associations between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure to ACTOS and bladder cancer were not detected in some studies including the 10-year observational study in the U.S., but were in others.
0	Inconsistent findings and limitations inherent in these and other studies preclude conclusive interpretations of the observational data.
0	ACTOS may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors.
0	There are insufficient data to determine whether pioglitazone is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.
0	Consequently, ACTOS should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits of glycemic control versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence with ACTOS should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer.
0	In controlled clinical trials, edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with ACTOS than in placebo-treated patients and is dose-related.
0	In postmarketing experience, reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received.
0	ACTOS should be used with caution in patients with edema.
0	Because thiazolidinediones, including ACTOS, can cause fluid retention, which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure, ACTOS should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure.
0	Patients treated with ACTOS should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure.
0	In PROactive (the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events), 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to ACTOS (N=2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N=2633) in addition to standard of care.
0	During a mean follow-up of 34.5 months, the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5.1% (44/870) for ACTOS versus 2.5% (23/905) for placebo.
0	This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study.
0	The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb.
0	No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with ACTOS (1.7%) versus placebo (2.1%).
0	The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients, especially female patients, treated with ACTOS and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care.
0	Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking ACTOS or another thiazolidinedione.
0	Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.
0	Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed.
0	Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione.
0	Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care.
0	Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist, regardless of the patient's underlying medications or other physical findings.
0	There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with ACTOS.
0	ACTOS is a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action.
0	ACTOS decreases insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output.
0	Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue.
0	Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR<U+03B3>).
0	PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver.
0	Activation of PPAR<U+03B3> nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism.
0	In animal models of diabetes, pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin-resistant states such as type 2 diabetes.
0	The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin-dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance.
0	Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin (by decreasing insulin resistance), it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin.
0	Clinical studies demonstrate that ACTOS improves insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients.
0	ACTOS enhances cellular responsiveness to insulin, increases insulin-dependent glucose disposal and improves hepatic sensitivity to insulin.
0	In patients with type 2 diabetes, the decreased insulin resistance produced by ACTOS results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, lower plasma insulin concentrations, and lower HbA1c values.
0	In controlled clinical trials, ACTOS had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin.
0	Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with ACTOS.
0	Overall, patients treated with ACTOS had mean decreases in serum triglycerides, mean increases in HDL cholesterol, and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol.
0	There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with ACTOS.
0	In a 26-week, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging monotherapy study, mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg ACTOS dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group.
0	Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with ACTOS than in the placebo-treated patients.
0	There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with ACTOS compared to placebo.

0	Following once-daily administration of ACTOS, steady-state serum concentrations of both pioglitazone and its major active metabolites, M-III (keto derivative of pioglitazone) and M-IV (hydroxyl derivative of pioglitazone), are achieved within seven days.
0	At steady-state, M-III and M-IV reach serum concentrations equal to or greater than that of pioglitazone.
0	At steady-state, in both healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone comprises approximately 30% to 50% of the peak total pioglitazone serum concentrations (pioglitazone plus active metabolites) and 20% to 25% of the total AUC.
0	Cmax, AUC, and trough serum concentrations (Cmin) for pioglitazone and M-III and M-IV, increased proportionally with administered doses of 15 mg and 30 mg per day.
0	Absorption Following oral administration of pioglitazone, Tmax of pioglitazone was within two hours.
1	Food delays the Tmax to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC).
0	Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of pioglitazone following single-dose administration is 0.63 <U+00B1> 0.41 (mean <U+00B1> SD) L/kg of body weight.
0	Pioglitazone is extensively protein bound (>99%) in human serum, principally to serum albumin.
0	Pioglitazone also binds to other serum proteins, but with lower affinity.
0	M-III and M-IV are also extensively bound (>98%) to serum albumin.
0	Metabolism Pioglitazone is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation and oxidation; the metabolites also partly convert to glucuronide or sulfate conjugates.
0	Metabolites M-III and M-IV are the major circulating active metabolites in humans.
0	In vitro data demonstrate that multiple CYP isoforms are involved in the metabolism of pioglitazone, which include CYP2C8 and, to a lesser degree, CYP3A4 with additional contributions from a variety of other isoforms including the mainly extrahepatic CYP1A1.
0	In vivo study of pioglitazone in combination with gemfibrozil, a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, showed that pioglitazone is a CYP2C8 substrate.
0	Urinary 6<U+00C3><U+0178>-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratios measured in patients treated with ACTOS showed that pioglitazone is not a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducer.
0	Excretion and Elimination Following oral administration, approximately 15% to 30% of the pioglitazone dose is recovered in the urine.
0	Renal elimination of pioglitazone is negligible, and the drug is excreted primarily as metabolites and their conjugates.
0	It is presumed that most of the oral dose is excreted into the bile either unchanged or as metabolites and eliminated in the feces.
0	The mean serum half-life (t1/2) of pioglitazone and its metabolites (M-III and M-IV) range from three to seven hours and 16 to 24 hours, respectively.
0	Pioglitazone has an apparent clearance, CL/F, calculated to be five to seven L/hr.
0	Renal Impairment The serum elimination half-life of pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV remains unchanged in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance [CLcr] 30 to 50 mL/min) and severe (CLcr <30 mL/min) renal impairment when compared to subjects with normal renal function.
0	Therefore, no dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is required.
0	Hepatic Impairment Compared with healthy controls, subjects with impaired hepatic function (Child-Turcotte-Pugh Grade B/C) have an approximate 45% reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone (pioglitazone, M-III, and M-IV) mean Cmax but no change in the mean AUC values.
0	Therefore, no dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is required.
0	There are postmarketing reports of liver failure with ACTOS and clinical trials have generally excluded patients with serum ALT >2.5 times the upper limit of the reference range.
0	Use caution in patients with liver disease.
0	Geriatric Patients In healthy elderly subjects, Cmax of pioglitazone was not significantly different, but AUC values were approximately 21% higher than those achieved in younger subjects.
0	The mean t1/2 of pioglitazone was also prolonged in elderly subjects (about ten hours) as compared to younger subjects (about seven hours).
0	These changes were not of a magnitude that would be considered clinically relevant.
0	Pediatric Patients Safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in pediatric patients have not been established.
0	ACTOS is not recommended for use in pediatric patients.
0	Gender The mean Cmax and AUC values of pioglitazone were increased 20% to 60% in women compared to men.
0	In controlled clinical trials, HbA1c decreases from baseline were generally greater for females than for males (average mean difference in HbA1c 0.5%).
0	Because therapy should be individualized for each patient to achieve glycemic control, no dose adjustment is recommended based on gender alone.
0	Ethnicity Pharmacokinetic data among various ethnic groups are not available.

0	In addition, ARIXTRA neither influenced the pharmacodynamics of warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid, piroxicam, and digoxin, nor the pharmacokinetics of digoxin at steady state.
0	Agents that may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of therapy with ARIXTRA unless these agents are essential.
0	If co-administration is necessary, monitor patients closely for hemorrhage.
1	In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%.
0	Inhibition of the other isozymes evaluated (CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and 3E1) was 0 to 16%.
0	Since fondaparinux does not markedly inhibit CYP450s (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4) in vitro,fondaparinux sodium is not expected to significantly interact with other drugs in vivo by inhibition of metabolism mediated by these isozymes.
0	Since fondaparinux sodium does not bind significantly to plasma proteins other than ATIII, no drug interactions by protein-binding displacement are expected.
0	Discontinue agents that may enhance the risk of hemorrhage prior to initiation of therapy with ARIXTRA unless essential.
0	Spinal or epidural hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis, can occur.
0	Patients taking ARIXTRA with risk factors for bleeding are at increased risk of hemorrhage.
0	Bleeding risk is increased in renal impairment and in patients with low body weight <50 kg.
0	Thrombocytopenia can occur with administration of ARIXTRA.
0	Periodic routine complete blood counts (including platelet counts), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood tests are recommended (5.6) The packaging (needle guard) contains dry natural rubber and may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals (5.7) Spinal or epidural hematomas, which may result in long-term or permanent paralysis, can occur with the use of anticoagulants and neuraxial (spinal/epidural) anesthesia or spinal puncture.
0	The risk of these events may be higher with post-operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or concomitant use of other drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs.
0	In the postmarketing experience, epidural or spinal hematoma has been reported in association with the use of ARIXTRA by subcutaneous (SC) injection.
0	Optimal timing between the administration of ARIXTRA and neuraxial procedures is not known.
0	Monitor patients undergoing these procedures for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment such as midline back pain, sensory and motor deficits (numbness, tingling, or weakness in lower limbs), and bowel or bladder dysfunction.
0	Consider the potential risks and benefits before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or who may be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis.
0	ARIXTRA increases the risk of hemorrhage in patients at risk for bleeding, including conditions such as congenital or acquired bleeding disorders, active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease, hemorrhagic stroke, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, or shortly after brain, spinal, or ophthalmological surgery.
0	Cases of elevated aPTT temporally associated with bleeding events have been reported following administration of ARIXTRA (with or without concomitant administration of other anticoagulants).
0	Do not administer agents that enhance the risk of hemorrhage with ARIXTRA unless essential for the management of the underlying condition, such as vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of VTE.
0	If co-administration is essential, closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding.
0	Do not administer the initial dose of ARIXTRA earlier than 6 to 8 hours after surgery.
0	Administration earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases risk of major bleeding.
0	ARIXTRA increases the risk of bleeding in patients with impaired renal function due to reduced clearance.
0	The incidence of major bleeding by renal function status reported in clinical trials of patients receiving ARIXTRA for VTE surgical prophylaxis is provided in Table 1.
0	In these patient populations, the following is recommended: Do not use ARIXTRA for VTE prophylaxis and treatment in patients with CrCl <30 mL/min.

0	Discontinue the drug immediately in patients who develop severe renal impairment while on therapy.
0	After discontinuation of ARIXTRA, its anticoagulant effects may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function (i.e., at least 3 to 5 half-lives).
0	The anticoagulant effects of ARIXTRA may persist even longer in patients with renal impairment.
0	ARIXTRA increases the risk for bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, compared to patients with higher weights.
0	In patients who weigh less than 50 kg: Do not administer ARIXTRA as prophylactic therapy for patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery.
0	During the randomized clinical trials of VTE prophylaxis in the peri-operative period following hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery, major bleeding occurred at a higher rate among patients with a body weight <50 kg compared to those with a body weight >50 kg (5.4% versus 2.1% in patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery; 5.3% versus 3.3% in patients undergoing abdominal surgery).
0	Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of ARIXTRA.
0	Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely.
0	Discontinue ARIXTRA if the platelet count falls below 100,000/mm3.
0	Moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000/mm3 and 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 3.0% in patients given ARIXTRA 2.5 mg in the peri-operative hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery clinical trials.
0	Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3) occurred at a rate of 0.2% in patients given ARIXTRA 2.5 mg in these clinical trials.
0	During extended prophylaxis, no cases of moderate or severe thrombocytopenia were reported.
0	Moderate thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.5% in patients given the ARIXTRA treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials.
0	Severe thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0.04% in patients given the ARIXTRA treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials.
0	Occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia have been reported with the use of ARIXTRA in postmarketing experience.
0	Routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) are relatively insensitive measures of the activity of ARIXTRA and international standards of heparin or LMWH are not calibrators to measure anti-Factor Xa activity of ARIXTRA.
0	If unexpected changes in coagulation parameters or major bleeding occur during therapy with ARIXTRA, discontinue ARIXTRA.In postmarketing experience, occurrences of aPTT elevations have been reported following administration of ARIXTRA.
0	Periodic routine complete blood counts (including platelet count), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with ARIXTRA.
0	The anti-Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium can be measured by anti-Xa assay using the appropriate calibrator (fondaparinux).
0	The activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed in milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux and cannot be compared with activities of heparin or low molecular weight heparins.
0	The packaging (needle guard) of the prefilled syringe of ARIXTRA contains dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals.
0	The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux sodium is the result of antithrombin III (ATIII)-mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa.
0	By selectively binding to ATIII, fondaparinux sodium potentiates (about 300 times) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII.
0	Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development.
0	Fondaparinux sodium does not inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II) and has no known effect on platelet function.
0	At the recommended dose, fondaparinux sodium does not affect fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time.
0	The pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium are derived from fondaparinux plasma concentrations quantified via anti-Factor Xa activity.
0	Only fondaparinux can be used to calibrate the anti-Xa assay.
0	(The international standards of heparin or LMWH are not appropriate for this use.)
0	As a result, the activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed as milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux calibrator.
0	The anti-Xa activity of the drug increases with increasing drug concentration, reaching maximum values in approximately three hours.
0	Fondaparinux sodium administered by subcutaneous injection is rapidly and completely absorbed (absolute bioavailability is 100%).
0	Following a single subcutaneous dose of fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg in young male subjects, Cmax of 0.34 mg/L is reached in approximately 2 hours.
0	In patients undergoing treatment with fondaparinux sodium injection 2.5 mg, once daily, the peak steady-state plasma concentration is, on average, 0.39 to 0.50 mg/L and is reached approximately 3 hours post-dose.
0	In these patients, the minimum steady-state plasma concentration is 0.14 to 0.19 mg/L.
0	In patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism undergoing treatment with fondaparinux sodium injection 5 mg (body weight <50 kg), 7.5 mg (body weight 50 to 100 kg), and 10 mg (body weight >100 kg) once daily, the body<U+2013>weight-adjusted doses provide similar mean steady-state peaks and minimum plasma concentrations across all body weight categories.
0	The mean peak steady-state plasma concentration is in the range of 1.20 to 1.26 mg/L.
0	In these patients, the mean minimum steady-state plasma concentration is in the range of 0.46 to 0.62 mg/L.
0	In healthy adults, intravenously or subcutaneously administered fondaparinux sodium distributes mainly in blood and only to a minor extent in extravascular fluid as evidenced by steady state and non-steady state apparent volume of distribution of 7 to 11 L. Similar fondaparinux distribution occurs in patients undergoing elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery.
0	In vitro, fondaparinux sodium is highly (at least 94%) and specifically bound to antithrombin III (ATIII) and does not bind significantly to other plasma proteins (including platelet Factor 4 [PF4]) or red blood cells.
0	In vivo metabolism of fondaparinux has not been investigated since the majority of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in urine in individuals with normal kidney function.
0	In individuals with normal kidney function, fondaparinux is eliminated in urine mainly as unchanged drug.
0	In healthy individuals up to 75 years of age, up to 77% of a single subcutaneous or intravenous fondaparinux dose is eliminated in urine as unchanged drug in 72 hours.
0	The elimination half-life is 17 to 21 hours.
0	Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients with renal impairment since the major route of elimination is urinary excretion of unchanged drug.
0	In patients undergoing prophylaxis following elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery, the total clearance of fondaparinux is approximately 25% lower in patients with mild renal impairment (CrCl 50 to 80 mL/min), approximately 40% lower in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min), and approximately 55% lower in patients with severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min) compared to patients with normal renal function.
0	A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and extent of renal impairment was observed in DVT treatment patients.
0	Following a single, subcutaneous dose of 7.5 mg of ARIXTRA in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Category B), Cmax and AUC were decreased by 22% and 39%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal liver function.
0	The changes from baseline in pharmacodynamic parameters, such as aPTT, PT/INR, and antithrombin III, were similar in normal subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
0	Based on these data, no dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients.
0	However, a higher incidence of hemorrhage was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in normal subjects.
0	The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
0	The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux have not been investigated in pediatric patients.
0	Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients older than 75 years.

0	A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and age was observed in DVT treatment patients.
0	Total clearance of fondaparinux sodium is decreased by approximately 30% in patients weighing less than 50 kg.
0	The pharmacokinetic properties of fondaparinux sodium are not significantly affected by gender.
0	Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied prospectively.
0	However, studies performed in Asian (Japanese) healthy subjects did not reveal a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to Caucasian healthy subjects.
0	Similarly, no plasma clearance differences were observed between black and Caucasian patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.
0	NUVIGIL is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to modafinil or armodafinil or its inactive ingredients.
0	NUVIGIL is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to modafinil or armodafinil.
0	The recommended dosage of NUVIGIL for each indication is as follows: OSA or Narcolepsy: 150 mg to 250 mg once a day in the morning.
0	SWD: 150 mg once a day, taken approximately one hour prior to start of the work shift.
0	Hepatic Impairment: reduced dose in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
0	Geriatric Patients: consider lower dose.
0	The recommended dosage of NUVIGIL for patients with OSA or narcolepsy is 150 mg to 250 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose in the morning.
0	In patients with OSA, doses up to 250 mg/day, given as a single dose, have been well tolerated, but there is no consistent evidence that these doses confer additional benefit beyond that of the 150 mg/day dose.
0	The recommended dosage of NUVIGIL for patients with SWD is 150 mg taken orally once a day as a single dose approximately 1 hour prior to the start of their work shift.
0	In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the dosage of NUVIGIL should be reduced.
0	Consideration should be given to the use of lower doses and close monitoring in geriatric patients.
1	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP3A4/5 Substrates The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by NUVIGIL via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.
0	Dosage adjustment of these drugs should be considered when these drugs are used concomitantly with NUVIGIL.
0	The effectiveness of steroidal contraceptives may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL and for one month after discontinuation of therapy.
0	Alternative or concomitant methods of contraception are recommended for patients taking steroidal contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) when treated concomitantly with NUVIGIL and for one month after discontinuation of NUVIGIL treatment.
1	Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with NUVIGIL.
0	Monitoring of circulating cyclosporine concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustment for cyclosporine should be considered when used concomitantly with NUVIGIL.
1	Effects of NUVIGIL on CYP2C19 Substrates Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by NUVIGIL via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.
0	Dose reduction of these drugs may be required when these drugs are used concomitantly with NUVIGIL.
0	Warfarin More frequent monitoring of prothrombin times/INR should be considered whenever NUVIGIL is coadministered with warfarin.
0	Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors Caution should be used when concomitantly administering MAO inhibitors and NUVIGIL.
0	Steroidal contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl estradiol): use alternative or concomitant methods of contraception while taking NUVIGIL and for one month after discontinuation of NUVIGIL treatment.
1	Cyclosporine: blood concentrations of cyclosporine may be reduced.
1	CYP2C19 substrates, such as omeprazole, phenytoin, and diazepam: exposure of these medications may be increased.
0	Serious Rash, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome: discontinue NUVIGIL at the first sign of rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related.
0	DRESS/Multi-organ Hypersensitivity Reactions: if suspected, discontinue NUVIGIL.
0	Angioedema and Anaphylaxis Reactions: if suspected, discontinue NUVIGIL.
0	Persistent Sleepiness: assess patients frequently for degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, advise patients to avoid driving or engaging in any other potentially dangerous activity.
0	Psychiatric Symptoms: use particular caution in treating patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania.
0	Consider discontinuing NUVIGIL if psychiatric symptoms develop.
0	Known Cardiovascular Disease: consider increased monitoring.
0	Serious rash requiring hospitalization and discontinuation of treatment has been reported in association with the use of NUVIGIL (armodafinil) or modafinil (the racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers).
0	NUVIGIL has not been studied in pediatric patients in any setting and is not approved for use in pediatric patients for any indication.
0	In clinical trials of modafinil, the incidence of rash resulting in discontinuation was approximately 0.8% (13 per 1,585) in pediatric patients (age <17 years); these rashes included 1 case of possible Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and 1 case of apparent multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction/ Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS).
0	Several of the cases were associated with fever and other abnormalities (e.g., vomiting, leukopenia).
0	The median time to rash that resulted in discontinuation was 13 days.
0	No such cases were observed among 380 pediatric patients who received placebo.
0	Skin and mouth sores, blistering, and ulceration have been reported with modafinil and NUVIGIL in the postmarketing setting.
0	Recurrence of signs and symptoms of serious dermatologic reactions following rechallenge has been reported in some cases.
0	Rare cases of serious or life-threatening rash, including SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in adults and children in worldwide postmarketing experience with modafinil and NUVIGIL.
0	There are no factors, including duration of therapy, that are known to predict the risk of occurrence or the severity of rash associated with modafinil or NUVIGIL.
0	In cases where the time to onset was reported, serious rash occurred 1 day to 2 months after initiation of treatment, but isolated cases of serious dermatologic reactions have been reported with symptoms beginning after prolonged treatment (e.g., 3 months).
0	Although benign rashes also occur with NUVIGIL, it is not possible to reliably predict which rashes will prove to be serious.
0	Accordingly, NUVIGIL should be discontinued at the first sign of rash, skin or mouth sores, or blistering or ulceration, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related.
0	Discontinuation of treatment may not prevent a rash from becoming life-threatening or permanently disabling or disfiguring.
0	DRESS, also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has been reported with NUVIGIL.
0	DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection.
0	This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved.
0	It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident.
0	One fatal case of DRESS that occurred in close temporal association (3 weeks) with the initiation of NUVIGIL treatment has been reported in the postmarketing setting.
0	In addition, multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions, including at least one fatality in postmarketing experience, have occurred in close temporal association (median time to detection 13 days; range 4-33) to the initiation of modafinil.
0	Although there have been a limited number of reports, multi-organ hypersensitivity reactions may result in hospitalization or be life-threatening.
0	If a multi-organ hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, NUVIGIL should be discontinued.
0	Although there are no case reports to indicate cross-sensitivity with other drugs that produce this syndrome, the experience with drugs associated with multi-organ hypersensitivity would indicate this to be a possibility.
0	Angioedema and hypersensitivity (with rash, dysphagia, and bronchospasm), were observed with NUVIGIL.
0	Patients should be advised to discontinue therapy and immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema or anaphylaxis (e.g., swelling of face, eyes, lips, tongue or larynx; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness).
0	Patients with abnormal levels of sleepiness who take NUVIGIL should be advised that their level of wakefulness may not return to normal.
0	Patients with excessive sleepiness, including those taking NUVIGIL, should be frequently reassessed for their degree of sleepiness and, if appropriate, advised to avoid driving or any other potentially dangerous activity.
0	Prescribers should also be aware that patients may not acknowledge sleepiness or drowsiness until directly questioned about drowsiness or sleepiness during specific activities.
0	In pre-approval narcolepsy, OSA and SWD controlled trials of NUVIGIL, anxiety, agitation, nervousness, and irritability were reasons for treatment discontinuation more often in patients on NUVIGIL compared to placebo (NUVIGIL 1.2% and placebo 0.3%).
0	Depression was also a reason for treatment discontinuation more often in patients on NUVIGIL compared to placebo (NUVIGIL 0.6% and placebo 0.2%).
0	Cases of suicidal ideation were observed in clinical trials.
0	Caution should be exercised when NUVIGIL is given to patients with a history of psychosis, depression, or mania.
0	If psychiatric symptoms develop in association with NUVIGIL administration, consider discontinuing NUVIGIL.
0	Psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported in patients treated with modafinil.
0	Modafinil and NUVIGIL (armodafinil) are very closely related.
0	Therefore, the incidence and type of psychiatric symptoms associated with NUVIGIL are expected to be similar to the incidence and type of these events with modafinil.
0	Postmarketing adverse reactions associated with the use of NUVIGIL, some of which have resulted in hospitalization, have included mania, delusions, hallucinations, suicidal ideation, and aggression.
0	Many, but not all, patients who developed psychiatric adverse reactions had a prior psychiatric history.
0	In these cases, reported NUVIGIL total daily doses ranged from 50 mg to 450 mg, which includes doses below and above the recommended dosages.
0	Although NUVIGIL has not been shown to produce functional impairment, any drug affecting the central nervous system (CNS) may alter judgment, thinking or motor skills.
0	Patients should be cautioned about operating an automobile or other hazardous machinery until it is reasonably certain that NUVIGIL therapy will not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.
0	In clinical studies of modafinil, cardiovascular adverse reactions, including chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea and transient ischemic T-wave changes on ECG were observed in three subjects in association with mitral valve prolapse or left ventricular hypertrophy.
0	It is recommended that NUVIGIL tablets not be used in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or in patients with mitral valve prolapse who have experienced the mitral valve prolapse syndrome when previously receiving CNS stimulants.
0	Findings suggestive of mitral valve prolapse syndrome include but are not limited to ischemic ECG changes, chest pain, or arrhythmia.
0	If new onset of any of these findings occurs, consider cardiac evaluation.
0	Blood pressure monitoring in short term (<U+2264> 3 months) pre-approval controlled trials of OSA, SWD, and narcolepsy showed small average increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving NUVIGIL as compared to placebo (1.2 to 4.3 mmHg in the various experimental groups).
0	There was also a slightly greater proportion of patients on NUVIGIL requiring new or increased use of antihypertensive medications (2.9%) compared to patients on placebo (1.8%).
0	There was a small, but consistent, average increase in pulse rate over placebo in pre-approval controlled trials.
0	This increase varied from 0.9 to 3.5 BPM.
0	Increased monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure may be appropriate in patients on NUVIGIL.
0	Caution should be exercised when prescribing NUVIGIL to patients with known cardiovascular disease.
0	The mechanism(s) through which armodafinil promotes wakefulness is unknown.
0	Armodafinil (R-modafinil) has pharmacological properties similar to those of modafinil (a mixture of R- and S-modafinil), to the extent tested in animal and in vitro studies.
0	The R- and S-enantiomers have similar pharmacological actions in animals.
0	Armodafinil and modafinil have wake-promoting actions similar to sympathomimetic agents including amphetamine and methylphenidate, although their pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines.
0	Modafinil-induced wakefulness can be attenuated by the <U+03B1>1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin; however, modafinil is inactive in other in vitro assay systems known to be responsive to <U+03B1>-adrenergic agonists such as the rat vas deferens preparation.
0	Armodafinil is an indirect dopamine receptor agonist; both armodafinil and modafinil bind in vitro to the dopamine transporter and inhibit dopamine reuptake.
0	For modafinil, this activity has been associated in vivo with increased extracellular dopamine levels in some brain regions of animals.
0	In genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT), modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent.
0	However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of amphetamine, were not antagonized by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats.
0	In addition, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, a dopamine synthesis inhibitor, blocks the action of amphetamine, but does not block locomotor activity induced by modafinil.
0	In addition to its wake-promoting effects and ability to increase locomotor activity in animals, modafinil produces psychoactive and euphoric effects, alterations in mood, perception, thinking, and feelings typical of other CNS stimulants in humans.
0	Modafinil has reinforcing properties, as evidenced by its self-administration in monkeys previously trained to self-administer cocaine; modafinil was also partially discriminated as stimulant-like.
0	Based on nonclinical studies, two major metabolites, acid and sulfone, of modafinil or armodafinil, do not appear to contribute to the CNS-activating properties of the parent compounds.
0	Armodafinil exhibits linear time-independent kinetics following single and multiple oral dose administration.
0	Increase in systemic exposure is proportional over the dose range of 50 to 400 mg. No time-dependent change in kinetics was observed through 12 weeks of dosing.
0	Apparent steady state for armodafinil was reached within 7 days of dosing.
0	At steady state, the systemic exposure for armodafinil is 1.8 times the exposure observed after a single dose.
0	The concentration-time profiles of the R-enantiomer following administration of a single-dose of 50 mg NUVIGIL or 100 mg PROVIGIL (modafinil, a 1:1 mixture of R- and S-enantiomers) are nearly superimposable.
0	However, the Cmax and AUC0-<U+221E>, of armodafinil at steady-state were approximately 37% and 70% higher, respectively, following administration of 200 mg NUVIGIL than the corresponding values of modafinil following administration of 200 mg PROVIGIL due to the more rapid clearance of the S-enantiomer (elimination half-life approximately 4 hours) as compared to the R-enantiomer.
0	Absorption NUVIGIL is readily absorbed after oral administration.
0	The absolute oral bioavailability was not determined due to the aqueous insolubility of armodafinil, which precluded intravenous administration.
0	Peak plasma concentrations are attained at approximately 2 hours in the fasted state.
1	Food effect on the overall bioavailability of NUVIGIL is considered minimal; however, time to reach peak concentration (tmax) may be delayed by approximately 2-4 hours in the fed state.
0	Since the delay in tmax is also associated with elevated plasma concentrations later in time, food can potentially affect the onset and time course of pharmacologic action for NUVIGIL.
0	Distribution NUVIGIL has an apparent volume of distribution of approximately 42 L. Data specific to armodafinil protein binding are not available.
0	However, modafinil is moderately bound to plasma protein (approximately 60%), mainly to albumin.
0	The potential for interactions of NUVIGIL with highly protein<U+2011>bound drugs is considered to be minimal.
0	Elimination After oral administration of NUVIGIL, armodafinil exhibits an apparent monoexponential decline from the peak plasma concentration.
0	The apparent terminal t<U+00BD> is approximately 15 hours.
0	The oral clearance of NUVIGIL is approximately 33 mL/min.
0	Metabolism In vitro and in vivo data show that armodafinil undergoes hydrolytic deamidation, S-oxidation, and aromatic ring hydroxylation, with subsequent glucuronide conjugation of the hydroxylated products.
0	Amide hydrolysis is the single most prominent metabolic pathway, with sulfone formation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5 being next in importance.
0	The other oxidative products are formed too slowly in vitro to enable identification of the enzyme(s) responsible.
0	Only two metabolites reach appreciable concentrations in plasma (i.e., R-modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone).
0	Excretion Data specific to NUVIGIL disposition are not available.
0	However, modafinil is mainly eliminated via metabolism, predominantly in the liver, with less than 10% of the parent compound excreted in the urine.
0	A total of 81% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in 11 days post-dose, predominantly in the urine (80% vs. 1.0% in the feces).
0	Specific Populations Age In a clinical study, systemic exposure of armodafinil was approximately 15% higher in elderly subjects (<U+2265>65 years of age, N=24), corresponding to approximately 12% lower oral clearance (CL/F), as compared to young subjects (18-45 years of age, N=25).
0	Systemic exposure of armodafinil acid (metabolite) was approximately 61% and 73% greater for Cmax and AUC0-<U+03C4>, respectively, compared to young subjects.
0	Systemic exposure of the sulfone metabolite was approximately 20% lower for elderly subjects compared with young subjects.
0	A subgroup analysis of elderly subjects demonstrated elderly subjects <U+2265>75 and 65-74 years of age had approximately 21% and 9% lower oral clearance, respectively, compared to young subjects.
0	Systemic exposure was approximately 10% greater in subjects 65-74 years of age (N=17) and 27% greater in subjects <U+2265>75 years of age (N=7), respectively, when compared to young subjects.
0	The change is considered not likely to be clinically significant for elderly patients, however, because some elderly patients have greater exposure to armodafinil, consideration should be given to the use of lower doses.
0	Sex Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of armodafinil.
0	Ethnicity The influence of race/ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of armodafinil has not been studied.
0	Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of modafinil were examined in patients with cirrhosis of the liver (6 men and 3 women).
0	Three patients had stage B or B+ cirrhosis and 6 patients had stage C or C+ cirrhosis (per the Child-Pugh score criteria).
0	Clinically 8 of 9 patients were icteric and all had ascites.
0	In these patients, the oral clearance of modafinil was decreased by about 60% and the steady state concentration was doubled compared to normal patients.
0	Renal Impairment In a single dose 200 mg modafinil study, severe chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance <U+2264>20 mL/min) did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of modafinil, but exposure to modafinil acid (metabolite) was increased 9-fold.
0	Drug Interactions In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil weakly induces CYP1A2 and possibly CYP3A activities in a concentration-related manner and that CYP2C19 activity is reversibly inhibited by armodafinil.
0	Other CYP activities did not appear to be affected by armodafinil.
0	An in vitro study demonstrated that armodafinil is a substrate of P-glycoprotein.
0	Potential Interactions with Drugs That Inhibit, Induce, or Are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes and Other Hepatic Enzymes The existence of multiple pathways for armodafinil metabolism, as well as the fact that a non-CYP-related pathway is the most rapid in metabolizing armodafinil, suggest that there is a low probability of substantive effects on the overall pharmacokinetic profile of NUVIGIL due to CYP inhibition by concomitant medications.
0	However, due to the partial involvement of CYP3A enzymes in the metabolic elimination of armodafinil, coadministration of potent inducers of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin) or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) could alter the plasma concentrations of armodafinil.
0	The Potential of NUVIGIL to Alter the Metabolism of Other Drugs by Enzyme Induction or Inhibition Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4/5 In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil is a weak inducer of CYP3A activity in a concentration-related manner.
1	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg resulted in a reduction in systemic exposure to midazolam by 32% after a single oral dose (5 mg) and 17% after a single intravenous dose (2 mg).
1	Therefore, the blood levels and effectiveness of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A enzymes (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be reduced after initiation of concomitant treatment with NUVIGIL.In a separate clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 250 mg with quetiapine (300 mg to 600 mg daily doses) resulted in a reduction in the mean systemic exposure of quetiapine by approximately 29%.
0	Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2 In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil is a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in a concentration-related manner.
0	However, in a clinical study using caffeine as a probe substrate, no significant effect on CYP1A2 activity was observed.
0	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C19 In vitro data demonstrated that armodafinil is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C19 activity.
1	In a clinical study, concomitant administration of NUVIGIL 400 mg resulted in a 40% increase in exposure to omeprazole after a single oral dose (40 mg), as a result of moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 activity.
1	Interactions with CNS Active Drugs Concomitant administration of NUVIGIL with quetiapine reduced the systemic exposure of quetiapine.Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential with other CNS active drugs are not available.
0	However, the following available drug-drug interaction information on modafinil should be applicable to NUVIGIL.
1	Concomitant administration of modafinil with methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine produced no significant alterations on the pharmacokinetic profile of modafinil or either stimulant, even though the absorption of modafinil was delayed for approximately one hour.Concomitant modafinil or clomipramine did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of either drug; however, one incident of increased levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine was reported in a patient with narcolepsy during treatment with modafinil.Data specific to NUVIGIL or modafinil drug-drug interaction potential with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are not available.
0	Interaction with P-Glycoprotein An in vitro study demonstrated that armodafinil is a substrate of P-glycoprotein.
0	The impact of inhibition of P-glycoprotein is not known.
0	Interactions with Other Drugs Data specific to NUVIGIL drug-drug interaction potential for additional other drugs are not available.
0	However, the following available drug-drug interaction information on modafinil should be applicable to NUVIGIL.Warfarin: Concomitant administration of modafinil with warfarin did not produce significant changes in the pharmacokinetic profiles of R- and S-warfarin.
0	However, since only a single dose of warfarin was tested in this study, an interaction cannot be ruled out.
0	Seconal Sodium is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to barbiturates.
0	It is also contraindicated in patients with a history of manifest or latent porphyria, marked impairment of liver function, or respiratory disease in which dyspnea or obstruction is evident.
0	Dosages of barbiturates must be individualized with full knowledge of their particular characteristics.
0	Factors of consideration are the patient's age, weight, and condition.
0	Adults As a hypnotic, 100 mg at bedtime.
0	Preoperatively, 200 to 300 mg 1 to 2 hours before surgery.
0	Pediatric Patients Preoperatively, 2 to 6 mg/kg, with a maximum dosage of 100 mg. Special patient population Dosage should be reduced in the elderly or debilitated because these patients may be more sensitive to barbiturates.
0	Dosage should be reduced for patients with impaired renal function or hepatic disease.
0	Drug Interactions Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital.
0	However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.
0	Anticoagulants Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the prothrombin time.
1	Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (eg, warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon).
0	Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.
1	Corticosteroids Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes.
0	Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.
1	Griseofulvin Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level.
1	The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established.
0	However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.
1	Doxycycline Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic.
0	If barbiturates and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.
0	Phenytoin, Sodium Valproate, Valproic Acid The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable.
0	Some investigators report an accelerating effect, whereas others report no effect.
0	Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently.
1	Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the secobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, secobarbital sodium blood levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.
0	CNS Depressants The concomitant use of other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.
0	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates, probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.
1	Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism.
0	There have been reports of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (eg, phenobarbital) who become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives.
0	An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking barbiturates.
0	General Barbiturates may be habit-forming.
0	Tolerance and psychological and physical dependence may occur with continuing use.
0	Barbiturates should be administered with caution, if at all, to patients who are mentally depressed, have suicidal tendencies, or have a history of drug abuse.
0	Elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked excitement, depression, or confusion.
0	In some persons, especially pediatric patients, barbiturates repeatedly produce excitement rather than depression.
0	In patients with hepatic damage, barbiturates should be administered with caution and initially in reduced doses.
0	Barbiturates should not be administered to patients showing the premonitory signs of hepatic coma.
0	Information for Patients Sleep-Driving and Other Complex Behaviors There have been reports of people getting out of bed after taking a sedative-hypnotic and driving their cars while not fully awake, often with no memory of the event.
0	If a patient experiences such an episode, it should be reported to his or her doctor immediately, since sleep-driving can be dangerous.
0	This behavior is more likely to occur when sedative-hypnotics are taken with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants.
0	Other complex behaviors (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex) have been reported in patients who are not fully awake after taking a sedative-hypnotic.
0	As with <U+201C>sleep-driving<U+201D>, patients usually do not remember these events.
0	The following information should be given to patients receiving Seconal Sodium: 1.The use of Seconal Sodium carries with it an associated risk of psychological and/or physical dependence.
0	The patient should be warned against increasing the dose of the drug without consulting a physician.
0	2.Seconal Sodium may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery.
0	The patient should be cautioned accordingly.
0	3.Alcohol should not be consumed while taking Seconal Sodium.
0	The concurrent use of Seconal Sodium with other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, narcotics, tranquilizers, and antihistamines) may result in additional CNS-depressant effects.
0	Laboratory Tests Prolonged therapy with barbiturates should be accompanied by periodic laboratory evaluation of organic systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic systems.
0	Carcinogenesis Animal Data Phenobarbital sodium is carcinogenic in mice and rats after lifetime administration.
0	In mice, it produced benign and malignant liver cell tumors.
0	In rats, benign liver cell tumors were observed very late in life.
0	Human Data In a 29-year epidemiologic study of 9,136 patients who were treated on an anticonvulsant protocol that included phenobarbital, results indicated a higher than normal incidence of hepatic carcinoma.
0	Previously, some of these patients had been treated with thorotrast, a drug that is known to produce hepatic carcinomas.
0	Thus, this study did not provide sufficient evidence that phenobarbital sodium is carcinogenic in humans.A retrospective study of 84 pediatric patients with brain tumors matched to 73 normal controls and 78 cancer controls (malignant disease other than brain tumors) suggested an association between exposure to barbiturates prenatally and an increased incidence of brain tumors.
0	Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects See WARNINGS, Usage in Pregnancy.
0	Nonteratogenic Effects Reports of infants suffering from long-term barbiturate exposure in utero included the acute withdrawal syndrome of seizures and hyperirritability from birth to a delayed onset of up to 14 days.
0	Labor and Delivery Hypnotic doses of barbiturates do not appear to impair uterine activity significantly during labor.
0	Full anesthetic doses of barbiturates decrease the force and frequency of uterine contractions.
0	Administration of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates to the mother during labor may result in respiratory depression in the newborn.
0	Premature infants are particularly susceptible to the depressant effects of barbiturates.
0	If barbiturates are used during labor and delivery, resuscitation equipment should be available.
0	Data are not available to evaluate the effect of barbiturates when forceps delivery or other intervention is necessary or to determine the effect of barbiturates on the later growth, development, and functional maturity of the pediatric patient.
0	Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when Seconal Sodium is administered to a nursing woman, because small amounts of barbiturates are excreted in the milk.
0	Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and/or psychiatric disorder, symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient.
0	The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and/or medical illness that should be evaluated.
0	Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder.
0	Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs.
0	Because some of the important adverse effects of sedative-hypnotics appear to be dose related, it is important to use the smallest possible effective dose, especially in the elderly.
0	Complex behaviors such as sleep-driving (i.e., driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic, with amnesia for the event) have been reported.
0	These events can occur in sedative-hypnotic-na<U+00C3><U+00AF>ve as well as in sedative-hypnotic-experienced persons.
0	Although behaviors such as <U+201C>sleep-driving<U+201D> may occur with sedative-hypnotics alone at therapeutic doses, the use of alcohol and other CNS depressants with sedative-hypnotics appears to increase the risk of such behaviors, as does the use of sedative-hypnotics at doses exceeding the maximum recommended dose.
0	Due to the risk to the patient and the community, discontinuation of sedative-hypnotics should be strongly considered for patients who report a sleep-driving episode.
0	As with <U+201C>sleep-driving<U+201D> patients usually do not remember these events.
0	Habit-Forming Seconal Sodium may be habit-forming.
0	Tolerance and psychological and physical dependence may occur with continued use.
0	Patients who have psychological dependence on barbiturates may increase the dosage or decrease the dosage interval without consulting a physician and subsequently may develop a physical dependence on barbiturates.
0	To minimize the possibility of overdosage or development of dependence, the prescribing and dispensing of sedative-hypnotic barbiturates should be limited to the amount required for the interval until the next appointment.
0	The abrupt cessation after prolonged use in a person who is dependent on the drug may result in withdrawal symptoms, including delirium, convulsions, and possibly death.
0	Barbiturates should be withdrawn gradually from any patient known to be taking excessive doses over long periods of time.
0	Acute or Chronic Pain Caution should be exercised when barbiturates are administered to patients with acute or chronic pain, because paradoxical excitement could be induced or important symptoms could be masked.
0	Usage in Pregnancy Barbiturates can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
0	Retrospective, case-controlled studies have suggested that there may be a connection between the maternal consumption of barbiturates and a higher than expected incidence of fetal abnormalities.
0	Barbiturates readily cross the placental barrier and are distributed throughout fetal tissues; the highest concentrations are found in the placenta, fetal liver, and brain.
0	Fetal blood levels approach maternal blood levels following parenteral administration.Withdrawal symptoms occur in infants born to women who receive barbiturates throughout the last trimester of pregnancy.
0	If Seconal Sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.
0	Synergistic Effects The concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS depressants may produce additive CNS-depressant effects.
0	Barbiturates are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration, from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma.
0	In high enough therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia.
0	Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce drowsiness, sedation, and hypnosis.
0	Barbiturate-induced sleep differs from physiologic sleep.
0	Sleep laboratory studies have demonstrated that barbiturates reduce the amount of time spent in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase, or dreaming stage of sleep.
0	Also, Stages III and IV sleep are decreased.
0	Following abrupt cessation of regularly used barbiturates, patients may experience markedly increased dreaming, nightmares, and/or insomnia.
0	Therefore, withdrawal of a single therapeutic dose over 5 or 6 days has been recommended to lessen the REM rebound and disturbed sleep that contribute to drug withdrawal syndrome (for example, decreasing the dose from 3 to 2 doses a day for 1 week).
0	In studies, secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium have been found to lose most of their effectiveness for both inducing and maintaining sleep by the end of 2 weeks of continued drug administration, even with the use of multiple doses.
0	As with secobarbital sodium and pentobarbital sodium, other barbiturates (including amobarbital) might be expected to lose their effectiveness for inducing and maintaining sleep after about 2 weeks.
0	The short-, intermediate-, and to a lesser degree, long-acting barbiturates have been widely prescribed for treating insomnia.
0	Although the clinical literature abounds with claims that the short-acting barbiturates are superior for producing sleep whereas the intermediate-acting compounds are more effective in maintaining sleep, controlled studies have failed to demonstrate these differential effects.
0	Therefore, as sleep medications, the barbiturates are of limited value beyond short-term use.
0	Barbiturates have little analgesic action at subanesthetic doses.
0	Rather, in subanesthetic doses, these drugs may increase the reaction to painful stimuli.
0	All barbiturates exhibit anticonvulsant activity in anesthetic doses.
0	However, of the drugs in this class, only phenobarbital, mephobarbital, and metharbital are effective as oral anticonvulsants in subhypnotic doses.
0	Barbiturates are respiratory depressants, and the degree of depression is dependent on the dose.
0	With hypnotic doses, respiratory depression is similar to that which occurs during physiologic sleep accompanied by a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.
0	Studies in laboratory animals have shown that barbiturates cause reduction in the tone and contractility of the uterus, ureters, and urinary bladder.
0	However, concentrations of the drugs required to produce this effect in humans are not reached with sedative-hypnotic doses.
0	Barbiturates do not impair normal hepatic function, but have been shown to induce liver microsomal enzymes, thus increasing and/or altering the metabolism of barbiturates and other drugs.
0	Pharmacokinetics Barbiturates are absorbed in varying degrees following oral or parenteral administration.
0	The salts are more rapidly absorbed than are the acids.
0	The rate of absorption is increased if the sodium salt is ingested as a dilute solution or taken on an empty stomach.
0	Duration of action, which is related to the rate at which the barbiturates are redistributed throughout the body, varies among persons and in the same person from time to time.
0	Seconal Sodium is classified as a short-acting barbiturate when taken orally.
0	Its onset of action is 10 to 15 minutes and its duration of action ranges from 3 to 4 hours.
0	Barbiturates are weak acids that are absorbed and rapidly distributed to all tissues and fluids, with high concentrations in the brain, liver, and kidneys.
0	Lipid solubility of the barbiturates is the dominant factor in their distribution within the body.
0	The more lipid soluble the barbiturate, the more rapidly it penetrates all tissues of the body.
0	Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree, with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility.
0	Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action.
0	At the opposite extreme is secobarbital, which has the highest lipid solubility, highest plasma protein binding, highest brain protein binding, the shortest delay in onset of activity, and the shortest duration of action.
0	The plasma half-life for secobarbital sodium in adults ranges between 15 to 40 hours, with a mean of 28 hours.
0	No data are available for pediatric patients and newborns.
0	Barbiturates are metabolized primarily by the hepatic microsomal enzyme system, and the metabolic products are excreted in the urine and, less commonly, in the feces.
0	The excretion of unmetabolized barbiturate is 1 feature that distinguishes the long-acting category from those belonging to other categories, which are almost entirely metabolized.
0	The inactive metabolites of the barbiturates are excreted as conjugates of glucuronic acid.
0	Hepatotoxicity General Population: Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate and its derivatives.
0	These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment.
0	Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting.
0	In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur.
0	Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms.
0	Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months.
0	Children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple anticonvulsants, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease.
0	When Depacon is used in this patient group, it should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent.
0	The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks.
0	The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups.
0	Patients with Mitochondrial Disease: There is an increased risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase <U+03B3> (POLG) gene (e.g.
0	Depacon is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder.
0	In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, Depacon should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed.
0	This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with Depacon for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing.
0	POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice.
0	Fetal Risk Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida).
0	In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure.
0	Valproate should only be used to treat pregnant women with epilepsy if other medications have failed to control their symptoms or are otherwise unacceptable.
0	Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition.
0	This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine).
0	Women should use effective contraception while using valproate.
0	Pancreatitis Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate.
0	Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death.
0	Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use.
0	Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation.
0	If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued.
0	Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated.
0	WARNING: LIFE THREATENING ADVERSE REACTIONS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.
0	Hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, usually during the first 6 months of treatment.
0	Children under the age of two years and patients with mitochondrial disorders are at higher risk.
0	Monitor patients closely, and perform serum liver testing prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter (5.1) Fetal Risk, particularly neural tube defects, other major malformations, and decreased IQ (5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Pancreatitis, including fatal hemorrhagic cases (5.5)
0	Depacon should not be administered to patients with hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction.
0	Depacon is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase <U+03B3> (POLG; e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children under two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.
0	Depacon is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug.
0	Depacon is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders.
0	Hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction (4, 5.1) Known mitochondrial disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA polymerase <U+03B3> (POLG) (4, 5.1) Suspected POLG-related disorder in children under two years of age (4, 5.1) Known hypersensitivity to the drug (4, 5.11) Urea cycle disorders (4, 5.6)
0	Depacon is intended for intravenous use only.
0	Epilepsy Complex Partial Seizures in Adults and Children 10 years of age or older: Initial dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to10 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response.
0	Maximum recommended dose is 60 mg/kg/day (2.1).
0	Simple and Complex Absence Seizures: Initial dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at 1 week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response.
0	Use of Depacon for periods of more than 14 days has not been studied.
0	Patients should be switched to oral valproate products as soon as it is clinically feasible.
0	Depacon should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
0	In one clinical safety study, approximately 90 patients with epilepsy and with no measurable plasma levels of valproate were given single infusions of Depacon (up to 15 mg/kg and mean dose of 1184 mg) over 5-10 minutes (1.5-3.0 mg/kg/min).
0	Patients generally tolerated the more rapid infusions well.
0	This study was not designed to assess the effectiveness of these regimens.
0	For pharmacokinetics with rapid infusions, see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).
0	Initial Exposure to Valproate The following dosage recommendations were obtained from studies utilizing oral divalproex sodium products.
0	Complex Partial Seizures For adults and children 10 years of age or older.
0	Monotherapy (Initial Therapy) Depacon has not been systematically studied as initial therapy.
0	Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day.
0	The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response.
0	Ordinarily, optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day.
0	If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 to 100 mcg/mL).
0	No recommendation regarding the safety of valproate for use at doses above 60 mg/kg/day can be made.
0	The probability of thrombocytopenia increases significantly at total trough valproate plasma concentrations above 110 mcg/mL in females and 135 mcg/mL in males.
0	The benefit of improved seizure control with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.
0	Conversion to Monotherapy Patients should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day.
0	If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50-100 mcg/mL).
0	Concomitant antiepilepsy drug (AED) dosage can ordinarily be reduced by approximately 25% every 2 weeks.
0	This reduction may be started at initiation of Depacon therapy, or delayed by 1 to 2 weeks if there is a concern that seizures are likely to occur with a reduction.
0	The speed and duration of withdrawal of the concomitant AED can be highly variable, and patients should be monitored closely during this period for increased seizure frequency.
0	Adjunctive Therapy Depacon may be added to the patient's regimen at a dosage of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day.
0	The dosage may be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response.
0	If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in divided doses.
0	In a study of adjunctive therapy for complex partial seizures in which patients were receiving either carbamazepine or phenytoin in addition to valproate, no adjustment of carbamazepine or phenytoin dosage was needed.
0	However, since valproate may interact with these or other concurrently administered AEDs as well as other drugs, periodic plasma concentration determinations of concomitant AEDs are recommended during the early course of therapy.
0	Simple and Complex Absence Seizures The recommended initial dose is 15 mg/kg/day, increasing at one week intervals by 5 to 10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects preclude further increases.
0	The maximum recommended dosage is 60 mg/kg/day.
0	A good correlation has not been established between daily dose, serum concentrations, and therapeutic effect.
0	However, therapeutic valproate serum concentration for most patients with absence seizures is considered to range from 50 to 100 mcg/mL.
0	Some patients may be controlled with lower or higher serum concentrations.
0	As the Depacon dosage is titrated upward, blood concentrations of phenobarbital and/or phenytoin may be affected.
0	Antiepilepsy drugs should not be abruptly discontinued in patients in whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life.
0	Replacement Therapy When switching from oral valproate products, the total daily dose of Depacon should be equivalent to the total daily dose of the oral valproate product, and should be administered as a 60 minute infusion (but not more than 20 mg/min) with the same frequency as the oral products, although plasma concentration monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
0	Patients receiving doses near the maximum recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg/day, particularly those not receiving enzyme-inducing drugs, should be monitored more closely.
0	If the total daily dose exceeds 250 mg, it should be given in a divided regimen.
0	There is no experience with more rapid infusions in patients receiving Depacon as replacement therapy.
0	However, the equivalence shown between Depacon and oral valproate products (Depakote) at steady state was only evaluated in an every 6 hour regimen.
0	Whether, when Depacon is given less frequently (i.e., twice or three times a day), trough levels fall below those that result from an oral dosage form given via the same regimen, is unknown.
0	For this reason, when Depacon is given twice or three times a day, close monitoring of trough plasma levels may be needed.
0	Dosing in Elderly Patients Due to a decrease in unbound clearance of valproate and possibly a greater sensitivity to somnolence in the elderly, the starting dose should be reduced in these patients.
0	Dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions.
0	Dose reductions or discontinuation of valproate should be considered in patients with decreased food or fluid intake and in patients with excessive somnolence.
0	The ultimate therapeutic dose should be achieved on the basis of both tolerability and clinical response.
0	Dose-Related Adverse Reactions The frequency of adverse effects (particularly elevated liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia) may be dose-related.
0	The probability of thrombocytopenia appears to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of <U+2265> 110 mcg/mL (females) or <U+2265> 135 mcg/mL (males).
0	The benefit of improved therapeutic effect with higher doses should be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse reactions.
0	Administration Rapid infusion of Depacon has been associated with an increase in adverse reactions.
0	There is limited experience with infusion times of less than 60 minutes or rates of infusion > 20 mg/min in patients with epilepsy.
0	Depacon should be administered intravenously as a 60 minute infusion, as noted above.
0	It should be diluted with at least 50 mL of a compatible diluent.
0	Any unused portion of the vial contents should be discarded.
0	Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.
0	Compatibility and Stability Depacon was found to be physically compatible and chemically stable in the following parenteral solutions for at least 24 hours when stored in glass or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags at controlled room temperature 15-30<U+00B0>C (59-86<U+00B0>F). dextrose (5%) injection, USP sodium chloride (0.9%) injection, USP lactated ringer's injection, USP Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.
1	Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance.
0	Therefore increased monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations and dosage adjustment are indicated whenever enzyme-inducing or inhibiting drugs are introduced or withdrawn (7.1) Aspirin, carbapenem antibiotics, estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives: Monitoring of valproate concentrations is recommended (7.1) Co-administration of valproate can affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs (e.g. diazepam, ethosuximide, lamotrigine, phenytoin) by inhibiting their metabolism or protein binding displacement (7.2) Patients stabilized on rufinamide should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to clinically effective dose (7.2) Dosage adjustment of amitriptyline/nortriptyline, propofol, warfarin, and zidovudine may be necessary if used concomitantly with Depacon (7.2) Topiramate: Hyperammonemia and encephalopathy (5.9, 7.3) Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases (such as ritonavir), may increase the clearance of valproate.
1	For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate.
1	Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.
0	In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.
0	Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.
0	The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics.
0	The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

1	Felbamate A study involving the co-administration of 1,200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n = 10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone.
1	Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase).
1	A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.
1	Rifampin A study involving the administration of a single dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate.

0	Drugs for which either no interaction or a likely clinically unimportant interaction has been observed Antacids A study involving the co-administration of valproate 500 mg with commonly administered antacids (Maalox, Trisogel, and Titralac - 160 mEq doses) did not reveal any effect on the extent of absorption of valproate.
1	Chlorpromazine A study involving the administration of 100 to 300 mg/day of chlorpromazine to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed a 15% increase in trough plasma levels of valproate.
0	Haloperidol A study involving the administration of 6 to 10 mg/day of haloperidol to schizophrenic patients already receiving valproate (200 mg BID) revealed no significant changes in valproate trough plasma levels.
0	Cimetidine and Ranitidine Cimetidine and ranitidine do not affect the clearance of valproate.
0	Valproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and glucuronosyltransferases.
0	The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate co-administration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed medications.
0	The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

1	Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received.
0	Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity.
0	Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline.
1	Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.
1	Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.
0	Clonazepam The concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence type seizures.
1	Diazepam Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism.
1	Co-administration of valproate (1,500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n = 6).
1	Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate.
0	The elimination half-life of diazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate.
1	Ethosuximide Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide.
1	Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n = 6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone.
0	Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs.
1	Lamotrigine In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase).
1	The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate.
0	Serious skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with concomitant lamotrigine and valproate administration.
0	See lamotrigine package insert for details on lamotrigine dosing with concomitant valproate administration.
1	Phenobarbital Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital.
1	Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n = 6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose).
1	The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.
0	There is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or valproate serum concentrations.
0	All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurological toxicity.
1	Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.
0	Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with valproate.
1	Phenytoin Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism.
1	Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n = 7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin.
1	Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate.
1	Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.
0	In patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the combination of valproate and phenytoin.
0	The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by the clinical situation.
1	Propofol The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol.
1	Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate.
0	Monitor patients closely for signs of increased sedation or cardiorespiratory depression.
1	Rufinamide Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate.
1	Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate).
1	Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose.
1	Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).
1	Tolbutamide From in vitro experiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate.
0	The clinical relevance of this displacement is unknown.
1	Warfarin In an in vitro study, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%.
0	The therapeutic relevance of this is unknown; however, coagulation tests should be monitored if valproate therapy is instituted in patients taking anticoagulants.
1	Zidovudine In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.

1	Co-administration of valproate (500 mg BID) and olanzapine (5 mg) to healthy adults (n=10) caused 15% reduction in Cmax and 35% reduction in AUC of olanzapine.
0	Oral Contraceptive Steroids Administration of a single-dose of ethinyloestradiol (50 mcg)/levonorgestrel (250 mcg) to 6 women on valproate (200 mg BID) therapy for 2 months did not reveal any pharmacokinetic interaction.
0	Concomitant administration of valproate and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy.
0	Concomitant administration of topiramate with valproate has also been associated with hypothermia in patients who have tolerated either drug alone.
0	It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels in patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported.
0	Hepatotoxicity; evaluate high risk populations and monitor serum liver tests (5.1) Birth defects and decreased IQ following in utero exposure; only use to treat pregnant women with epilepsy if other medications are unacceptable; should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless essential (5.2, 5.3, 5.4) Pancreatitis; Depacon should ordinarily be discontinued (5.5) Bleeding and other hematopoietic disorders; monitor platelet counts and coagulation tests (5.7) Hyperammonemia and hyperammonemic encephalopathy; measure ammonia level if unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, and also with concomitant topiramate use; consider discontinuation of valproate therapy (5.6, 5.8, 5.9) Hypothermia; Hypothermia has been reported during valproate therapy with or without associated hyperammonemia.
0	This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate (5.10) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction; discontinue Depacon (5.11) Somnolence in the elderly can occur.
0	Depacon dosage should be increased slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake (5.13) General Information on Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate.
0	Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months of valproate therapy.
0	However, healthcare providers should not rely totally on serum biochemistry since these tests may not be abnormal in all instances, but should also consider the results of careful interim medical history and physical examination.
0	Caution should be observed when administering valproate products to patients with a prior history of hepatic disease.
0	Patients on multiple anticonvulsants, children, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease may be at particular risk.
0	See below, <U+201C>Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease.<U+201D> Experience has indicated that children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those with the aforementioned conditions.
0	Use of Depacon has not been studied in children below the age of 2 years.
0	In progressively older patient groups experience in epilepsy has indicated that the incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably.
0	Patients with Known or Suspected Mitochondrial Disease Depacon is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder.
0	Valproate-induced acute liver failure and liver-related deaths have been reported in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by mutations in the gene for mitochondrial DNA polymerase <U+03B3> (POLG) (e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) at a higher rate than those without these syndromes.
0	Most of the reported cases of liver failure in patients with these syndromes have been identified in children and adolescents.
0	POLG-related disorders should be suspected in patients with a family history or suggestive symptoms of a POLG-related disorder, including but not limited to unexplained encephalopathy, refractory epilepsy (focal, myoclonic), status epilepticus at presentation, developmental delays, psychomotor regression, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, myopathy cerebellar ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, or complicated migraine with occipital aura.
0	POLG mutation testing should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice for the diagnostic evaluation of such disorders.
0	The A467T and W748S mutations are present in approximately 2/3 of patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders.
0	This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with Depacon for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver test monitoring.
0	The drug should be discontinued immediately in the presence of significant hepatic dysfunction, suspected or apparent.
0	In some cases, hepatic dysfunction has progressed in spite of discontinuation of drug.
0	Valproate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.
0	Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, limb malformations).
0	The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies.
0	Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population.
0	Valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure.
0	Published epidemiological studies have indicated that children exposed to valproate in utero have lower cognitive test scores than children exposed in utero to either another antiepileptic drug or to no antiepileptic drugs.
0	The largest of these studies1 is a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States and United Kingdom that found that children with prenatal exposure to valproate (n=62) had lower IQ scores at age 6 (97 [95% C.I.
0	94-101]) than children with prenatal exposure to the other antiepileptic drug monotherapy treatments evaluated: lamotrigine (108 [95% C.I.
0	It is not known when during pregnancy cognitive effects in valproate-exposed children occur.
0	Because the women in this study were exposed to antiepileptic drugs throughout pregnancy, whether the risk for decreased IQ was related to a particular time period during pregnancy could not be assessed.
0	Although all of the available studies have methodological limitations, the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that valproate exposure in utero can cause decreased IQ in children.
0	In animal studies, offspring with prenatal exposure to valproate had malformations similar to those seen in humans and demonstrated neurobehavioral deficits.
0	Women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant should not be treated with valproate unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable.
0	In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks.
0	Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ and major congenital malformations (including neural tube defects), which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition.
0	Women who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled regarding the relative risks and benefits of valproate use during pregnancy, and alternative therapeutic options should be considered for these patients.
0	To prevent major seizures, valproate should not be discontinued abruptly, as this can precipitate status epilepticus with resulting maternal and fetal hypoxia and threat to life.
0	It is not known whether the risk of neural tube defects or decreased IQ in the offspring of women receiving valproate is reduced by folic acid supplementation.
0	Dietary folic acid supplementation both prior to conception and during pregnancy should be routinely recommended for patients using valproate.
0	Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate.
0	Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with rapid progression from initial symptoms to death.
0	Some cases have occurred shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use.
0	The rate based upon the reported cases exceeds that expected in the general population and there have been cases in which pancreatitis recurred after rechallenge with valproate.
0	In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of pancreatitis without alternative etiology in 2416 patients, representing 1044 patient-years experience.
0	If pancreatitis is diagnosed, Depacon should ordinarily be discontinued.
0	Depacon is contraindicated in patients with known urea cycle disorders (UCD).
0	Hyperammonemic encephalopathy, sometimes fatal, has been reported following initiation of valproate therapy in patients with urea cycle disorders, a group of uncommon genetic abnormalities, particularly ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.
0	Prior to the initiation of Depacon therapy, evaluation for UCD should be considered in the following patients: 1) those with a history of unexplained encephalopathy or coma, encephalopathy associated with a protein load, pregnancy-related or postpartum encephalopathy, unexplained mental retardation, or history of elevated plasma ammonia or glutamine; 2) those with cyclical vomiting and lethargy, episodic extreme irritability, ataxia, low BUN, or protein avoidance; 3) those with a family history of UCD or a family history of unexplained infant deaths (particularly males); 4) those with other signs or symptoms of UCD.
0	Patients who develop symptoms of unexplained hyperammonemic encephalopathy while receiving valproate therapy should receive prompt treatment (including discontinuation of valproate therapy) and be evaluated for underlying urea cycle disorders.
0	Valproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia.
0	In a clinical trial of Depakote (divalproex sodium) as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets <U+2264> 75 x 109/L.
0	Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal.
0	In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment.
0	In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of <U+2265> 110 mcg/mL (females) or <U+2265> 135 mcg/mL (males).
0	The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects.
0	Valproate use has also been associated with decreases in other cell lines and myelodysplasia.
0	Because of reports of cytopenias, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters (e.g., low fibrinogen, coagulation factor deficiencies, acquired von Willebrand<U+2019>s disease), measurements of complete blood counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals.
0	It is recommended that patients receiving Depacon be monitored for blood counts and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery and during pregnancy.
0	Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.
0	Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests.
0	In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.
0	Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia.
0	If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued.
0	Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders.
0	Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels.
0	If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.
0	Concomitant administration of topiramate and valproate has been associated with hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy in patients who have tolerated either drug alone.
0	Clinical symptoms of hyperammonemic encephalopathy often include acute alterations in level of consciousness and/or cognitive function with lethargy or vomiting.
0	Hypothermia can also be a manifestation of hyperammonemia.
0	In most cases, symptoms and signs abated with discontinuation of either drug.
0	This adverse reaction is not due to a pharmacokinetic interaction.
0	Patients with inborn errors of metabolism or reduced hepatic mitochondrial activity may be at an increased risk for hyperammonemia with or without encephalopathy.
0	Although not studied, an interaction of topiramate and valproate may exacerbate existing defects or unmask deficiencies in susceptible persons.
0	In patients who develop unexplained lethargy, vomiting, or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured.
0	Hypothermia, defined as an unintentional drop in body core temperature to <35<U+00B0>C (95<U+00B0>F), has been reported in association with valproate therapy both in conjunction with and in the absence of hyperammonemia.
0	This adverse reaction can also occur in patients using concomitant topiramate with valproate after starting topiramate treatment or after increasing the daily dose of topiramate.
0	Consideration should be given to stopping valproate in patients who develop hypothermia, which may be manifested by a variety of clinical abnormalities including lethargy, confusion, coma, and significant alterations in other major organ systems such as the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
0	Clinical management and assessment should include examination of blood ammonia levels.
0	Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking valproate.
0	DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, and/or lymphadenopathy, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection.
0	Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved.
0	It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident.
0	If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately.
0	Valproate should be discontinued and not be resumed if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.
0	Carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) may reduce serum valproate concentrations to subtherapeutic levels, resulting in loss of seizure control.
0	Serum valproate concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy.
0	Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproate concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates.
0	In a double-blind, multicenter trial of valproate in elderly patients with dementia (mean age = 83 years), doses were increased by 125 mg/day to a target dose of 20 mg/kg/day.
0	A significantly higher proportion of valproate patients had somnolence compared to placebo, and although not statistically significant, there was a higher proportion of patients with dehydration.
0	Discontinuations for somnolence were also significantly higher than with placebo.
0	In some patients with somnolence (approximately one-half), there was associated reduced nutritional intake and weight loss.
0	There was a trend for the patients who experienced these events to have a lower baseline albumin concentration, lower valproate clearance, and a higher BUN.
0	In elderly patients, dosage should be increased more slowly and with regular monitoring for fluid and nutritional intake, dehydration, somnolence, and other adverse reactions.
0	A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of IV valproate in the prevention of post-traumatic seizures in patients with acute head injuries.
0	Patients were randomly assigned to receive either IV valproate given for one week (followed by oral valproate products for either one or six months per random treatment assignment) or IV phenytoin given for one week (followed by placebo).
0	In this study, the incidence of death was found to be higher in the two groups assigned to valproate treatment compared to the rate in those assigned to the IV phenytoin treatment group (13% vs. 8.5%, respectively).
0	Many of these patients were critically ill with multiple and/or severe injuries, and evaluation of the causes of death did not suggest any specific drug-related causation.
0	Further, in the absence of a concurrent placebo control during the initial week of intravenous therapy, it is impossible to determine if the mortality rate in the patients treated with valproate was greater or less than that expected in a similar group not treated with valproate, or whether the rate seen in the IV phenytoin treated patients was lower than would be expected.
0	Nonetheless, until further information is available, it seems prudent not to use Depacon in patients with acute head trauma for the prophylaxis of post-traumatic seizures.
0	Since valproate may interact with concurrently administered drugs which are capable of enzyme induction, periodic plasma concentration determinations of valproate and concomitant drugs are recommended during the early course of therapy.
0	Valproate is partially eliminated in the urine as a keto-metabolite which may lead to a false interpretation of the urine ketone test.
0	There have been reports of altered thyroid function tests associated with valproate.
0	The clinical significance of these is unknown.
0	There are in vitro studies that suggest valproate stimulates the replication of the HIV and CMV viruses under certain experimental conditions.
0	The clinical consequence, if any, is not known.
0	Additionally, the relevance of these in vitro findings is uncertain for patients receiving maximally suppressive antiretroviral therapy.
0	Nevertheless, these data should be borne in mind when interpreting the results from regular monitoring of the viral load in HIV infected patients receiving valproate or when following CMV infected patients clinically.
0	Depacon exists as the valproate ion in the blood.
0	The mechanisms by which valproate exerts its therapeutic effects have not been established.
0	It has been suggested that its activity in epilepsy is related to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
0	The relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response is not well documented.
0	One contributing factor is the nonlinear, concentration dependent protein binding of valproate which affects the clearance of the drug.
0	Thus, monitoring of total serum valproate cannot provide a reliable index of the bioactive valproate species.
0	For example, because the plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent, the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL.
0	Higher than expected free fractions occur in the elderly, in hyperlipidemic patients, and in patients with hepatic and renal diseases.
0	Epilepsy The therapeutic range in epilepsy is commonly considered to be 50 to 100 mcg/mL of total valproate, although some patients may be controlled with lower or higher plasma concentrations.
0	Equivalent doses of Depacon and Depakote (divalproex sodium) yield equivalent plasma levels of the valproate ion.
0	Bioavailability Equivalent doses of intravenous (IV) valproate and oral valproate products are expected to result in equivalent Cmax, Cmin, and total systemic exposure to the valproate ion when the IV valproate is administered as a 60 minute infusion.
0	However, the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation used.
0	These differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy.
0	Administration of Depakote (divalproex sodium) tablets and IV valproate (given as a one hour infusion), 250 mg every 6 hours for 4 days to 18 healthy male volunteers resulted in equivalent AUC, Cmax, Cmin at steady state, as well as after the first dose.
0	The Tmax after IV Depacon occurs at the end of the one hour infusion, while the Tmax after oral dosing with Depakote occurs at approximately 4 hours.
0	Because the kinetics of unbound valproate are linear, bioequivalence between Depacon and Depakote up to the maximum recommended dose of 60 mg/kg/day can be assumed.
0	The AUC and Cmax resulting from administration of IV valproate 500 mg as a single one hour infusion and a single 500 mg dose of Depakene syrup to 17 healthy male volunteers were also equivalent.
0	Patients maintained on valproic acid doses of 750 mg to 4250 mg daily (given in divided doses every 6 hours) as oral Depakote (divalproex sodium) alone (n = 24) or with another stabilized antiepileptic drug [carbamazepine (n = 15), phenytoin (n = 11), or phenobarbital (n = 1)], showed comparable plasma levels for valproic acid when switching from oral Depakote to IV valproate (1-hour infusion).
0	Eleven healthy volunteers were given single infusions of 1000 mg IV valproate over 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes in a 4-period crossover study.
0	Total valproate concentrations were measured; unbound concentrations were not measured.
0	After the 5 minute infusions (mean rate of 2.8 mg/kg/min), mean Cmax was 145 <U+00B1> 32 mcg/mL, while after the 60 minute infusions, mean Cmax was 115 <U+00B1> 8 mcg/mL.
0	Ninety to 120 minutes after infusion initiation, total valproate concentrations were similar for all 4 rates of infusion.
0	Because protein binding is nonlinear at higher total valproate concentrations, the corresponding increase in unbound Cmax at faster infusion rates will be greater.
0	Distribution Protein Binding The plasma protein binding of valproate is concentration dependent and the free fraction increases from approximately 10% at 40 mcg/mL to 18.5% at 130 mcg/mL.
1	Protein binding of valproate is reduced in the elderly, in patients with chronic hepatic diseases, in patients with renal impairment, and in the presence of other drugs (e.g., aspirin).
1	Conversely, valproate may displace certain protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, and tolbutamide).
0	CNS Distribution Valproate concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) approximate unbound concentrations in plasma (about 10% of total concentration).
0	Metabolism Valproate is metabolized almost entirely by the liver.
0	In adult patients on monotherapy, 30-50% of an administered dose appears in urine as a glucuronide conjugate.
0	Mitochondrial <U+03B2>-oxidation is the other major metabolic pathway, typically accounting for over 40% of the dose.
0	Usually, less than 15-20% of the dose is eliminated by other oxidative mechanisms.
0	Less than 3% of an administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine.
0	The relationship between dose and total valproate concentration is nonlinear; concentration does not increase proportionally with the dose, but rather, increases to a lesser extent due to saturable plasma protein binding.
0	Elimination Mean plasma clearance and volume of distribution for total valproate are 0.56 L/hr/1.73 m2 and 11 L/1.73 m2, respectively.
0	Mean terminal half-life for valproate monotherapy after an intravenous infusion of 1,000 mg was 16 <U+00B1> 3.0 hours.
0	The estimates cited apply primarily to patients who are not taking drugs that affect hepatic metabolizing enzyme systems.
1	For example, patients taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital) will clear valproate more rapidly.
0	Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of antiepileptic concentrations should be intensified whenever concomitant antiepileptics are introduced or withdrawn.
0	Special Populations Effect of Age Neonates Children within the first two months of life have a markedly decreased ability to eliminate valproate compared to older children and adults.
0	This is a result of reduced clearance (perhaps due to delay in development of glucuronosyltransferase and other enzyme systems involved in valproate elimination) as well as increased volume of distribution (in part due to decreased plasma protein binding).
0	For example, in one study, the half-life in children under 10 days ranged from 10 to 67 hours compared to a range of 7 to 13 hours in children greater than 2 months.
0	Children Pediatric patients (i.e., between 3 months and 10 years) have 50% higher clearances expressed on weight (i.e., mL/min/kg) than do adults.
0	Over the age of 10 years, children have pharmacokinetic parameters that approximate those of adults.
0	Elderly The capacity of elderly patients (age range: 68 to 89 years) to eliminate valproate has been shown to be reduced compared to younger adults (age range: 22 to 26 years).
0	Intrinsic clearance is reduced by 39%; the free fraction is increased by 44%.
0	Accordingly, the initial dosage should be reduced in the elderly.
0	Effect of Sex There are no differences in the body surface area adjusted unbound clearance between males and females (4.8 <U+00B1> 0.17 and 4.7 <U+00B1> 0.07 L/hr per 1.73 m2, respectively).
0	Effect of Race The effects of race on the kinetics of valproate have not been studied.
0	Effect of Disease Liver Disease Liver disease impairs the capacity to eliminate valproate.
0	In one study, the clearance of free valproate was decreased by 50% in 7 patients with cirrhosis and by 16% in 4 patients with acute hepatitis, compared with 6 healthy subjects.
0	In that study, the half-life of valproate was increased from 12 to 18 hours.
0	Liver disease is also associated with decreased albumin concentrations and larger unbound fractions (2 to 2.6 fold increase) of valproate.
0	Accordingly, monitoring of total concentrations may be misleading since free concentrations may be substantially elevated in patients with hepatic disease whereas total concentrations may appear to be normal.
0	Renal Disease A slight reduction (27%) in the unbound clearance of valproate has been reported in patients with renal failure (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/minute); however, hemodialysis typically reduces valproate concentrations by about 20%.
0	Therefore, no dosage adjustment appears to be necessary in patients with renal failure.
0	Protein binding in these patients is substantially reduced; thus, monitoring total concentrations may be misleading.
0	ALBENZA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the benzimidazole class of compounds or any components of ALBENZA.

0	Patients being treated for neurocysticercosis should receive steroid and anticonvulsant therapy to prevent neurological symptoms (e.g. seizures, increased intracranial pressure and focal signs) as a result of an inflammatory reaction caused by death of the parasite within the brain.
0	Before initiating therapy for neurocysticercosis, examine the patient for the presence of retinal lesions.
0	If such lesions are visualized, weigh the need for anticysticeral therapy against the possibility of retinal damage resulting from inflammatory damage caused by ALBENZA-induced death of the parasite.
0	In clinical trials, treatment with ALBENZA has been associated with mild to moderate elevations of hepatic enzymes in approximately 16% of patients.
0	These elevations have generally returned to normal upon discontinuation of therapy.
0	There have also been case reports of acute liver failure of uncertain causality and hepatitis.

0	Patients with epidemiologic factors who are at risk for neurocysticercosis should be evaluated prior to initiation of therapy.
0	ALBENZA (albendazole) is a synthetic, antihelminthic drug of the class benzimidazole.
0	Absorption Albendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract due to its low aqueous solubility.
0	Albendazole concentrations are negligible or undetectable in plasma as it is rapidly converted to the sulfoxide metabolite prior to reaching the systemic circulation.
0	The systemic anthelmintic activity has been attributed to the primary metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide.
1	Oral bioavailability appears to be enhanced when albendazole is coadministered with a fatty meal (estimated fat content 40 grams) as evidenced by higher (up to 5-fold on average) plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide as compared to the fasted state.
0	Maximal plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were achieved 2 hours to 5 hours after dosing and were on average 1310 ng/mL (range 460 ng/mL to 1580 ng/mL) following oral doses of albendazole (400 mg) in 6 hydatid disease patients, when administered with a fatty meal.
0	Plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide increased in a dose-proportional manner over the therapeutic dose range following ingestion of a high-fat meal (fat content 43.1 grams).
0	The mean apparent terminal elimination half-life of albendazole sulfoxide ranged from 8 hours to 12 hours in 25 healthy subjects, as well as in 14 hydatid and 8 neurocysticercosis patients.
0	Following 4 weeks of treatment with albendazole (200 mg three times daily), 12 patients<U+2019> plasma concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide were approximately 20% lower than those observed during the first half of the treatment period, suggesting that albendazole may induce its own metabolism.
0	Distribution Albendazole sulfoxide is 70% bound to plasma protein and is widely distributed throughout the body; it has been detected in urine, bile, liver, cyst wall, cyst fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
0	Concentrations in plasma were 3-fold to 10-fold and 2-fold to 4-fold higher than those simultaneously determined in cyst fluid and CSF, respectively.
0	Metabolism and Excretion Albendazole is rapidly converted in the liver to the primary metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide, which is further metabolized to albendazole sulfone and other primary oxidative metabolites that have been identified in human urine.
0	Following oral administration, albendazole has not been detected in human urine.
0	Urinary excretion of albendazole sulfoxide is a minor elimination pathway with less than 1% of the dose recovered in the urine.
0	Biliary elimination presumably accounts for a portion of the elimination as evidenced by biliary concentrations of albendazole sulfoxide similar to those achieved in plasma.
0	Specific Populations Pediatrics Following single-dose administration of 200 mg to 300 mg (approximately 10 mg/kg) ALBENZA to 3 fasted and 2 fed pediatric patients with hydatid cyst disease (age range 6 to 13 years), albendazole sulfoxide pharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in fed adults.
0	Geriatrics Although no studies have investigated the effect of age on albendazole sulfoxide pharmacokinetics, data in 26 hydatid cyst patients (up to 79 years) suggest pharmacokinetics similar to those in young healthy subjects.
0	Mechanism of Action ALBENZA binds to the colchicine-sensitive site of <U+03B2>-tubulin inhibiting their polymerization into microtubules.
0	The decrease in microtubules in the intestinal cells of the parasites decreases their absorptive function, especially the uptake of glucose by the adult and larval forms of the parasites, and also depletes glycogen storage.
0	Insufficient glucose results in insufficient energy for the production of adenosine trisphosphate (ATP) and the parasite eventually dies.
0	Mechanism of Resistance Parasitic resistance to albendazole is caused by changes in amino acids that result in changes in the <U+03B2>-tubulin protein.
0	This causes reduced binding of the drug to <U+03B2>-tubulin.
0	In the specified treatment indications albendazole appears to be active against the larval forms of the following organisms: Echinococcus granulosus Taenia solium

0	CONTRAVE is not recommended for use in patients with end-stage renal disease.
0	There is a lack of adequate information to guide dosing in patients with mild renal impairment.
0	In patients with hepatic impairment, the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is one tablet in the morning.
0	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of therapy with CONTRAVE.
0	Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping CONTRAVE before starting an MAOI antidepressant.
1	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the maximum recommended daily dose of CONTRAVE is two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).
0	MAOIs: Increased risk of hypertensive reactions can occur when used concomitantly.
1	Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6 and can increase concentrations of: antidepressants, (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide): Consider dose reduction when using with CONTRAVE.
1	Concomitant Treatment with CYP2B6 Inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel) can increase bupropion exposure.
1	Do not exceed one tablet twice daily when taken with CYP2B6 inhibitors.
0	CYP2B6 Inducers (e.g., ritonavir, lopinavir, efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) may reduce efficacy by reducing bupropion exposure, avoid concomitant use.
0	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold: Dose CONTRAVE with caution.
0	Dopaminergic Drugs (levodopa and amantadine): CNS toxicity can occur when used concomitantly with CONTRAVE.
0	Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions: CONTRAVE can cause false-positive urine test results for amphetamines.
0	Concomitant use of MAOIs and bupropion is contraindicated.
0	Bupropion inhibits the re-uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine and can increase the risk for hypertensive reactions when used concomitantly with drugs that also inhibit the re-uptake of dopamine or norepinephrine, including MAOIs.
1	Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAOI phenelzine.
0	At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI and initiation of treatment with CONTRAVE.
0	Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping CONTRAVE before starting an MAOI.
0	Patients taking CONTRAVE may not fully benefit from treatment with opioid-containing medicines, such as cough and cold remedies, antidiarrheal preparations, and opioid analgesics.
0	In patients requiring intermittent opiate treatment, CONTRAVE therapy should be temporarily discontinued and opiate dose should not be increased above the standard dose.
0	CONTRAVE may be used with caution after chronic opioid use has been stopped for 7 to 10 days in order to prevent precipitation of withdrawal.
0	During CONTRAVE clinical studies, the use of concomitant opioid or opioid-like medications, including analgesics or antitussives, were excluded.
0	Metabolized by CYP2D6 In a clinical study, CONTRAVE (32 mg naltrexone/360 mg bupropion) daily was coadministered with a 50 mg dose of metoprolol (a CYP2D6 substrate).
1	CONTRAVE increased metoprolol AUC and Cmax by approximately 4- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to metoprolol alone.
1	Similar clinical drug interactions resulting in increased pharmacokinetic exposure of CYP2D6 substrates have also been observed with bupropion as a single agent with desipramine or venlafaxine.
1	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 isozyme including certain antidepressants (SSRIs and many tricyclics), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone and flecainide), should be approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of the dose range of the concomitant medication.
1	If CONTRAVE is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the original medication should be considered, particularly for those concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.
0	Bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6.
0	Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between CONTRAVE and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6.
1	Inhibitors of CYP2B6: Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposure but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure.
1	During concomitant use with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel), the CONTRAVE daily dose should not exceed two tablets (one tablet each morning and evening).
0	Inducers of CYP2B6: Ritonavir, Lopinavir, and Efavirenz: Concomitant treatment with these drugs can decrease bupropion and hydroxybupropion exposure and may reduce efficacy.
0	Avoiding concomitant use with ritonavir, lopinavir, or efavirenz is recommended.
0	Use extreme caution when coadministering CONTRAVE with other drugs that lower seizure threshold (e.g., antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, or systemic corticosteroids).
0	Use low initial doses and increase the dose gradually.
0	Concomitant use of other bupropion-containing products is contraindicated.
0	Bupropion, levodopa, and amantadine have dopamine agonist effects.
0	CNS toxicity has been reported when bupropion was coadministered with levodopa or amantadine.
0	Adverse reactions have included restlessness, agitation, tremor, ataxia, gait disturbance, vertigo, and dizziness.
0	It is presumed that the toxicity results from cumulative dopamine agonist effects.
0	Use caution and monitor for such adverse reactions when administering CONTRAVE concomitantly with these drugs.
0	In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with bupropion.
0	The consumption of alcohol during treatment with CONTRAVE should be minimized or avoided.
0	False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines have been reported in patients taking bupropion.
0	This is due to lack of specificity of some screening tests.
0	False-positive test results may result even following discontinuation of bupropion therapy.
0	Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish bupropion from amphetamines.
0	In vitro, CONTRAVE constituents inhibited the renal organic cation transporter OCT2 to a clinically relevant level.
1	The systemic concentrations of substrate drugs transported by OCT2 (such as amantadine, amiloride, cimetidine, dopamine, famotidine, memantine, metformin, pindolol, procainamide, ranitidine, varenicline, oxaliplatin) are likely to increase as a result of reduced renal clearance when coadministered with CONTRAVE.
0	Coadministration of CONTRAVE with such drugs should be approached with caution and patients should be monitored for adverse effects.
0	Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor for depression or suicidal thoughts.
0	Discontinue CONTRAVE if symptoms develop.
0	Risk of seizure may be minimized by adhering to the recommended dosing schedule and avoiding coadministration with high-fat meal.
0	Increase in Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Monitor blood pressure and heart rate in all patients, especially those with cardiac or cerebrovascular disease.
0	Hepatotoxicity: Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction observed with naltrexone exposure.
0	Angle-closure glaucoma: Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants.
0	Use of Antidiabetic Medications: Weight loss may cause hypoglycemia.
0	CONTRAVE contains bupropion, a dopamine and norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor that is similar to some drugs used for the treatment of depression; therefore, the following precautions pertaining to these products should be considered when treating patients with CONTRAVE.
0	Patients with major depressive disorder, both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs.
0	Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide.
0	There has been a long-standing concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.
0	In placebo-controlled clinical trials with CONTRAVE for the treatment of obesity in adult patients, no suicides or suicide attempts were reported in studies up to 56 weeks duration with CONTRAVE (equivalent to bupropion doses of 360 mg/day).
0	In these same studies, suicidal ideation was reported by 3 (0.20%) of 1,515 patients treated with placebo compared with 1 (0.03%) of 3,239 treated with CONTRAVE.
0	Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) show that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders.
0	Short-term clinical trials did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared with placebo in adults aged 65 and older.
0	The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of nine antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients.
0	The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of two months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients.
0	There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied.
0	There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD.
0	The risk differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications.
0	These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 2.
0	Risk Differences in the Number of Suicidality Cases by Age Group in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Subjects Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case <U+2265>65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the antidepressant pediatric trials.
0	There were suicides in the adult antidepressant trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.
0	It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months.
0	However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.
0	All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases.
0	This warning applies to CONTRAVE because one of its components, bupropion, is a member of an antidepressant class.
0	The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric.
0	Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.
0	Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient<U+2019>s presenting symptoms.
0	Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of anxiety, agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers.
0	Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers.
0	Prescriptions for CONTRAVE should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.
0	CONTRAVE is not approved for smoking cessation treatment, but serious neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients taking bupropion for smoking cessation.
0	These have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, hostility, agitation, aggression, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide.
0	Observe patients for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric reactions.
0	Instruct patients to contact a healthcare professional if such reactions occur.
0	In many of these cases, a causal relationship to bupropion treatment is not certain, because depressed mood can be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal.
0	Depression, suicide, attempted suicide and suicidal ideation have been reported in the postmarketing experience with naltrexone used in the treatment of opioid dependence.
0	No causal relationship has been demonstrated.
0	Bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, can cause seizures.
0	The incidence of seizure in patients receiving CONTRAVE in clinical trials was approximately 0.1% vs 0% on placebo.
0	CONTRAVE should be discontinued and not restarted in patients who experience a seizure while being treated with CONTRAVE.
0	The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold.
0	Consider these risks before initiating treatment with CONTRAVE.
0	CONTRAVE is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, current or prior diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs.
0	Caution should be used when prescribing CONTRAVE to patients with predisposing factors that may increase the risk of seizure including: history of head trauma or prior seizure, severe stroke, arteriovenous malformation, central nervous system tumor or infection, or metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia) excessive use of alcohol or sedatives, addiction to cocaine or stimulants, or withdrawal from sedatives patients with diabetes treated with insulin and/or oral diabetic medications (sulfonylureas and meglitinides) that may cause hypoglycemia concomitant administration of medications that may lower the seizure threshold, including other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, systemic steroids Recommendations for Reducing the Risk of Seizure: Clinical experience with bupropion suggests that the risk of seizure may be minimized by adhering to the recommended dosing recommendations, in particular: the total daily dose of CONTRAVE does not exceed 360 mg of the bupropion component (i.e., four tablets per day) the daily dose is administered in divided doses (twice daily) the dose is escalated gradually no more than two tablets are taken at one time coadministration of CONTRAVE with high-fat meals is avoided if a dose is missed, a patient should wait until the next scheduled dose to resume the regular dosing schedule Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose: CONTRAVE should not be administered to patients receiving chronic opioids, due to the naltrexone component, which is an opioid receptor antagonist.
0	If chronic opiate therapy is required, CONTRAVE treatment should be stopped.
0	In patients requiring intermittent opiate treatment, CONTRAVE therapy should be temporarily discontinued and lower doses of opioids may be needed.
0	Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after CONTRAVE treatment is discontinued.
0	An attempt by a patient to overcome any naltrexone opioid blockade by administering large amounts of exogenous opioids is especially dangerous and may lead to a fatal overdose or life-threatening opioid intoxication (e.g., respiratory arrest, circulatory collapse).
0	Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to overcome the opioid blockade.
0	Precipitated Opioid Withdrawal: The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal, which are associated with the discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual, are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be severe or necessitate hospitalization.
0	However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly, the resulting withdrawal syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization.
0	To prevent occurrence of either precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal symptoms, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting CONTRAVE treatment.
0	An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids, and those patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may need as long as two weeks.
0	Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use.
0	CONTRAVE can cause an increase in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure as well as an increase in resting heart rate.
0	In clinical practice with other bupropion-containing products, hypertension, in some cases severe and requiring acute treatment, has been reported.
0	The clinical significance of the increases in blood pressure and heart rate observed with CONTRAVE treatment is unclear, especially for patients with cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, since patients with a history of myocardial infarction or stroke in the previous 6 months, life-threatening arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure were excluded from CONTRAVE clinical trials.
0	Blood pressure and pulse should be measured prior to starting therapy with CONTRAVE and should be monitored at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice, particularly among patients with controlled hypertension prior to treatment.
0	CONTRAVE should not be given to patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
0	Among patients treated with CONTRAVE in placebo-controlled clinical trials, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was approximately 1 mmHg higher than baseline at Weeks 4 and 8, similar to baseline at Week 12, and approximately 1 mmHg below baseline between Weeks 24 and 56.
0	In contrast, among patients treated with placebo, mean blood pressure was approximately 2 to 3 mmHg below baseline throughout the same time points, yielding statistically significant differences between the groups at every assessment during this period.
0	The largest mean differences between the groups were observed during the first 12 weeks (treatment difference +1.8 to +2.4 mmHg systolic, all p<0.001; +1.7 to +2.1 mmHg diastolic, all p<0.001).
0	For heart rate, at both Weeks 4 and 8, mean heart rate was statistically significantly higher (2.1 bpm) in the CONTRAVE group compared with the placebo group; at Week 52, the difference between groups was +1.7 bpm (p<0.001).
0	In an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring substudy of 182 patients, the mean change from baseline in systolic blood pressure after 52 weeks of treatment was -0.2 mmHg for the CONTRAVE group and -2.8 mmHg for the placebo group (treatment difference, +2.6 mmHg, p=0.08); the mean change in diastolic blood pressure was +0.8 mmHg for the CONTRAVE group and -2.1 mmHg for the placebo group (treatment difference, +2.9 mmHg, p=0.004).
0	A greater percentage of subjects had adverse reactions related to blood pressure or heart rate in the CONTRAVE group compared to the placebo group (6.3% vs 4.2%, respectively), primarily attributable to adverse reactions of Hypertension/Blood Pressure Increased (5.9% vs 4.0%, respectively).
0	These events were observed in both patients with and without evidence of preexisting hypertension.
0	In a trial that enrolled individuals with diabetes, 12.0% of patients in the CONTRAVE group and 6.5% in the placebo group had a blood pressure-related adverse reaction.
0	Anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions characterized by symptoms such as pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and dyspnea requiring medical treatment have been reported in clinical trials with bupropion.
0	In addition, there have been rare spontaneous postmarketing reports of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and anaphylactic shock associated with bupropion.
0	Instruct patients to discontinue CONTRAVE and consult a healthcare provider if they develop an allergic or anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reaction (e.g., skin rash, pruritus, hives, chest pain, edema, or shortness of breath) during treatment.
0	Arthralgia, myalgia, fever with rash, and other symptoms suggestive of delayed hypersensitivity have been reported in association with bupropion.
0	These symptoms may resemble serum sickness.
0	Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone exposure during naltrexone clinical trials and in postmarketing reports for patients using naltrexone.
0	Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed.
0	When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including pre-existing alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and/or C infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs.
0	Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as a manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to systemic sequelae, including acute liver injury.
0	Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis.
0	Use of CONTRAVE should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.
0	In CONTRAVE clinical trials, there were no cases of elevated transaminases greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in conjunction with an increase in bilirubin greater than two times ULN.
0	Bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, is a drug used for the treatment of depression.
0	Antidepressant treatment can precipitate a manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode.
0	The risk appears to be increased in patients with bipolar disorder or who have risk factors for bipolar disorder.
0	Prior to initiating CONTRAVE, screen patients for a history of bipolar disorder and the presence of risk factors for bipolar disorder (e.g., family history of bipolar disorder, suicide, or depression).
0	CONTRAVE is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression.
0	No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in the clinical trials evaluating effects of CONTRAVE in obese patients; however, patients receiving antidepressant medications and patients with a history of bipolar disorder or recent hospitalization because of psychiatric illness were excluded from CONTRAVE clinical trials.
0	The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.
0	Weight loss may increase the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin and/or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas).
0	Measurement of blood glucose levels prior to starting CONTRAVE and during CONTRAVE treatment is recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes.
0	Decreases in medication doses for antidiabetic medications which are non-glucose-dependent should be considered to mitigate the risk of hypoglycemia.
0	If a patient develops hypoglycemia after starting CONTRAVE, appropriate changes should be made to the antidiabetic drug regimen.
0	CONTRAVE has two components: naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, and bupropion, a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.
0	Nonclinical studies suggest that naltrexone and bupropion have effects on two separate areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake: the hypothalamus (appetite regulatory center) and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit (reward system).
0	The exact neurochemical effects of CONTRAVE leading to weight loss are not fully understood.
0	Combined, bupropion and naltrexone increased the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in vitro, which are associated with regulation of appetite.
0	The combination of bupropion and naltrexone also reduced food intake when injected directly into the ventral tegmental area of the mesolimbic circuit in mice, an area associated with regulation of reward pathways.
0	Absorption Naltrexone Following single oral administration of CONTRAVE (two 8 mg naltrexone/90 mg bupropion tablets) to healthy subjects, mean peak naltrexone concentration (Cmax) was 1.4 ng/mL, time to peak concentration (Tmax) was 2 hours, and extent of exposure (AUC0-inf) was 8.4 ng<U+2219>hr/mL.
0	Bupropion Following single oral administration of CONTRAVE (two 8 mg naltrexone/90 mg bupropion tablets) to healthy subjects, mean peak bupropion concentration (Cmax) was 168 ng/mL, time to peak concentration (Tmax) was three hours, and extent of exposure (AUC0-inf) was 1,607 ng<U+2219>hr/mL.
1	Food Effect on Absorption When CONTRAVE was administered with a high-fat meal, the AUC and Cmax for naltrexone increased 2.1-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively, and the AUC and Cmax for bupropion increased 1.4-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively.
1	At steady state, the food effect increased AUC and Cmax for naltrexone by 1.7-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased AUC and Cmax for bupropion by 1.1-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively.
1	Thus, CONTRAVE should not be taken with high-fat meals because of the resulting significant increases in bupropion and naltrexone systemic exposure.
0	Distribution Naltrexone Naltrexone is 21% plasma protein bound.

0	Metabolism and Excretion Naltrexone The major metabolite of naltrexone is 6-beta-naltrexol.
0	The activity of naltrexone is believed to be the result of both the parent and the 6-beta-naltrexol metabolite.
0	Though less potent, 6-beta-naltrexol is eliminated more slowly and thus circulates at much higher concentrations than naltrexone.
0	Naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol are not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and in vitro studies indicate that there is no potential for inhibition or induction of important isozymes.
0	Naltrexone and its metabolites are excreted primarily by the kidney (53% to 79% of the dose).
0	Urinary excretion of unchanged naltrexone accounts for less than 2% of an oral dose.
0	Urinary excretion of unchanged and conjugated 6-beta-naltrexol accounts for 43% of an oral dose.
0	The renal clearance for naltrexone ranges from 30 to 127 mL/min, suggesting that renal elimination is primarily by glomerular filtration.

0	Fecal excretion is a minor elimination pathway.
0	Following single oral administration of CONTRAVE tablets to healthy subjects, mean elimination half-life (T1/2) was approximately 5 hours for naltrexone.
0	Following twice daily administration of CONTRAVE, naltrexone did not accumulate and its kinetics appeared linear.
0	However, in comparison to naltrexone, 6-beta-naltrexol accumulates to a larger extent (accumulation ratio ~3).
0	Bupropion Bupropion is extensively metabolized with three active metabolites: hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion.
0	The metabolites have longer elimination half-lives than bupropion and accumulate to a greater extent.
0	Following bupropion administration, more than 90% of the exposure is a result of metabolites.
0	In vitro findings suggest that CYP2B6 is the principal isozyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion whereas cytochrome P450 isozymes are not involved in the formation of the other active metabolites.
0	Bupropion and its metabolites inhibit CYP2D6.
0	Plasma protein binding of hydroxybupropion is similar to that of bupropion (84%) whereas the other two metabolites have approximately half the binding.
0	Following oral administration of 200 mg of 14C-bupropion in humans, 87% and 10% of the radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and feces, respectively.
0	The fraction of the oral dose of bupropion excreted unchanged was 0.5%, a finding consistent with the extensive metabolism of bupropion.
0	Following single oral administration of CONTRAVE tablets to healthy subjects, mean elimination half-life (T<U+00BD>) was approximately 21 hours for bupropion.
0	Following twice daily administration of CONTRAVE, metabolites of bupropion, and to a lesser extent unchanged bupropion, accumulate and reach steady-state concentrations in approximately one week.

0	A single-dose pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the disposition of bupropion and its metabolites in elderly subjects was similar to that of younger subjects.
0	These data suggest there is no prominent effect of age on bupropion concentration; however, another pharmacokinetic study, single and multiple dose, has suggested that the elderly are at increased risk for accumulation of bupropion and its metabolites.
0	Smokers Pooled analysis of CONTRAVE data revealed no meaningful differences in the plasma concentrations of bupropion or naltrexone in smokers compared with nonsmokers.

0	Bupropion The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion was characterized in two single-dose trials, one trial in patients with alcoholic liver disease and a second trial in patients with mild-to-severe cirrhosis.
0	The first trial showed that the half-life of hydroxybupropion was significantly longer in eight patients with alcoholic liver disease than in eight healthy volunteers (32<U+00B1>14 hours vs 21<U+00B1>5 hours, respectively).
0	Although not statistically significant, the AUCs for bupropion and hydroxybupropion were more variable and tended to be greater (by 53% to 57%) in patients with alcoholic liver disease.
0	The differences in half-life for bupropion and the other metabolites in the two patient groups were minimal.
0	The second trial demonstrated no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active metabolites in nine subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis compared with eight healthy volunteers.
0	However, more variability was observed in some of the pharmacokinetic parameters for bupropion (AUC, Cmax, and Tmax) and its active metabolites (t<U+00BD>) in subjects with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis.
0	In subjects with severe hepatic cirrhosis, significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites were seen (Table 4).

0	Bupropion Limited information is available for bupropion in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
0	An inter-trial comparison between normal subjects and patients with end-stage renal failure demonstrated that the bupropion Cmax and AUC values were comparable in the two groups, whereas the hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites had a 2.3- and 2.8-fold increase, respectively, in AUC for patients with end-stage renal failure.
0	A second trial, comparing normal subjects and patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment (GFR 30.9 <U+00B1> 10.8 mL/min) showed that exposure after a single 150 mg dose of sustained-release bupropion was approximately 2-fold higher in patients with impaired renal function while levels of the hydroxybupropion and threo/erythrohydrobupropion (combined) metabolites were similar in the two groups.

0	Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones.
0	Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones.
0	Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal.
0	These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4.
0	The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis.
0	When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP.
0	GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production.
0	By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner.
0	Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses.
0	General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period.
0	After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations.
0	The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal.
0	In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia.
0	Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents.
0	Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations.
0	Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations.
0	It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
0	Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo.
0	At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study.
0	Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec.
0	This increase is not considered to be clinically significant.
0	At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose.
0	In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration.
0	The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
0	Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 <U+03BC>Mhr, Cmax was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t1/2) was 12.4 hours.
0	Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose.
0	The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%).
0	The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
0	Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose.
0	The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%.
0	Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.

0	The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%).
0	Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination.
0	The apparent terminal t1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min.
0	Metabolism Following a [14C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin.
0	Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin.
0	In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8.
0	Excretion Following administration of an oral [14C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing.
0	Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion.
0	Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin.
0	The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established.
0	Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin.
0	However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin.
0	Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects.
0	Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and Cmax of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin.
0	These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful.
0	There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9).
0	Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin.
0	When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.
0	Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.
0	Pediatric Patients Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin in pediatric patients have not been performed.
0	Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4.
0	Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin.
0	Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways.
0	Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins.
0	Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low.
0	In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

0	Mechanism of Action: Valacyclovir is a nucleoside analogue DNA polymerase inhibitor.
0	Valacyclovir hydrochloride is rapidly converted to acyclovir which has demonstrated antiviral activity against HSV types 1 (HSV<U+2500>1) and 2 (HSV<U+2500>2) and VZV both in cell culture and in vivo.
0	The inhibitory activity of acyclovir is highly selective due to its affinity for the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by HSV and VZV.
0	This viral enzyme converts acyclovir into acyclovir monophosphate, a nucleotide analogue.
0	The monophosphate is further converted into diphosphate by cellular guanylate kinase and into triphosphate by a number of cellular enzymes.
0	In biochemical assays, acyclovir triphosphate inhibits replication of herpes viral DNA.
0	This is accomplished in 3 ways: 1) competitive inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, 2) incorporation and termination of the growing viral DNA chain, and 3) inactivation of the viral DNA polymerase.
0	The greater antiviral activity of acyclovir against HSV compared with VZV is due to its more efficient phosphorylation by the viral TK.
0	Antiviral Activities: The quantitative relationship between the cell culture susceptibility of herpesviruses to antivirals and the clinical response to therapy has not been established in humans, and virus sensitivity testing has not been standardized.
0	Sensitivity testing results, expressed as the concentration of drug required to inhibit by 50% the growth of virus in cell culture (EC50), vary greatly depending upon a number of factors.
0	Using plaque-reduction assays, the EC50 values against herpes simplex virus isolates range from 0.09 to 60 <U+03BC>M (0.02 to 13.5 mcg/mL) for HSV<U+2500>1 and from 0.04 to 44 <U+00B5>M (0.01 to 9.9 mcg/mL) for HSV<U+2500>2.
0	The EC50 values for acyclovir against most laboratory strains and clinical isolates of VZV range from 0.53 to 48 <U+00B5>M (0.12 to 10.8 mcg/mL).
0	Acyclovir also demonstrates activity against the Oka vaccine strain of VZV with a mean EC50 of 6 <U+00B5>M (1.35 mcg/mL).
0	Resistance: Resistance of HSV and VZV to acyclovir can result from qualitative and quantitative changes in the viral TK and/or DNA polymerase.
0	Clinical isolates of VZV with reduced susceptibility to acyclovir have been recovered from patients with AIDS.
0	In these cases, TK-deficient mutants of VZV have been recovered.
0	Resistance of HSV and VZV to acyclovir occurs by the same mechanisms.
0	While most of the acyclovir<U+2500>resistant mutants isolated thus far from immunocompromised patients have been found to be TK<U+2500>deficient mutants, other mutants involving the viral TK gene (TK partial and TK altered) and DNA polymerase have also been isolated.
0	TK<U+2500>negative mutants may cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients.
0	The possibility of viral resistance to valacyclovir (and therefore, to acyclovir) should be considered in patients who show poor clinical response during therapy.

0	Although laboratory tests have not indicated that pentazocine causes or increases renal or hepatic impairment, the drug should be administered with caution to patients with such impairment.
0	Since acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver, the question of the safety of its use in the presence of liver disease should be considered.
0	Narcotic drug products are generally considered to elevate biliary tract pressure for varying periods following their administration.
0	Some evidence suggests that pentazocine may differ from other marketed narcotics in this respect (i.e., it causes little or no elevation in biliary tract pressures).
0	The clinical significance of these findings, however, is not yet known.
0	Caution should be used when pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are administered to patients prone to seizures; seizures have occurred in a few such patients in association with the use of pentazocine although no cause and effect relationship has been established.

0	It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
0	Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets are administered to a nursing woman.
0	Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established.
0	Clinical studies of pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.
0	Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.
0	In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
0	Head Injury and Increased Intracranial Pressure.
0	As in the case of other potent analgesics, the potential of pentazocine for elevating cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be attributed to CO2 retention due to the respiratory depressant effects of the drug.
0	These effects may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, other intracranial lesions, or a pre-existing increase in intracranial pressure.
0	Furthermore, pentazocine can produce effects which may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injuries.
0	In such patients, pentazocine hydrochloride and acetaminophen tablets must be used with extreme caution and only if its use is deemed essential.
0	Patients receiving therapeutic doses of pentazocine have experienced hallucinations (usually visual), disorientation, and confusion which have cleared spontaneously within a period of hours.
0	The mechanism of this reaction is not known.
0	Such patients should be closely observed and vital signs checked.
0	If the drug is reinstituted, it should be done with caution since these acute CNS manifestations may recur.

0	Pentazocine has about 1/50 the antagonistic activity of nalorphine.
0	Pentazocine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
0	Plasma levels closely correspond to the onset, duration, and intensity of analgesia.
